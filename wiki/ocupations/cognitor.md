Cognitor
========

A Cognitor is an Adeptus Mechanicus magos specialized in information storage and retrieval.
Cognitors are savants, data addicts, born within the Mechaniucs.

A Cognitor is permanently affixed to a throne, connected by thick data wires to a very powerful data engine.
That throne is also connected to a [ThinkPod](../artefacts/thinkpod.md), which interfaces between the Cognitor and the hundreds of human minds they use to retrieve data from the [GrandArchive](../places/grand_archive.md).

Hierarchy
---------

Cognitors rank themselves according to which level of clearance files they can access.

### Archmagos Congitor

This is the highest-regarded Cognitor position. There is only one of them in the hive, and they are the only one with write access to the archive.
They are in charge of performing the sacred [Data Entry Rites](../traditions/data_entry_rites.md).
