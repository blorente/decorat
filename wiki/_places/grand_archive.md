The Grand Archive
=================

The Grand Archive is just a giant repostiory of information. It contains billions of articles on every area the Imperium has ever studied. These articles are interlinked via a very complex network of cross-references, that only [Cognitors](../_ocupations/cognitor.md) know how to navigate.

Many minds have been lost trying to navigate the archive, driven mad by endless information loops.
