Erika hadn't expected that when she approached the crowd.

She might have expected a firedrinker making his show, or even a few Arbites beating one of those street rats after catching them stealing, while everyone was busy wathing the firedrinker show. But not that.

She had seen raving fanatics before, for sure, but none of them right outside the civilian port of Decorat. Arching an eyebrow, she admitted to herself that this man had managed to surprise her.

She didn't have the patience for this right now. She was itching to get back to her family home after such a long time on the frontlines.

The bodies of passersby were starting to pack tighter and tighter -- too curious to continue with their day, but too scared to move into the circle, within the man's reach.

No Arbites in sight. She sighed. She would have to do something about this herself.

"Tristan, up!" The cat's mechanical legs whirred as it sprung up, seamlessly locking in the harness of her right shoulder.

With the cat safely perched on her back, Erika waded through the crowd to the edge of the clearing.

"Sir, in the name of House Belcroft, I'm going to need you to calm down and shut up." Said Erika, as she popped out of the wall of pedestrians somewhat less graciously than she'd hoped.

"Foolish girl! They're coming!" said the man. Erika felt the crowd retract behind her as the man stomped towards her. heh. It's been a while since somebody called me "girl".

As the man got within an inch of her face, Erika noticed the man's eyes. He was so close Erika could smell the cheap amasec in his breath, but he wasn't looking at her. He was looking past her, as if staring into the horizon. Despite that, Erika lowered her left hand to grip the hilt of her power estoc.

"Sir, I'm asking you nicely. Please calm down, and step away". Erika didn't have too much hope now, but she had to make it look like she was trying.

"Czokron! Scerzhond! Zhamnuz! They're coming! I've seen it! You will all fall, only their true servants will thrive! You'll see them and despair!" At "despair", a drip of wet gooey spit propelled out of the man's mouth, making its way onto Erika's cheek.

Alright, that does it. She rose the pummel of her sword, catching the man's diaphragm. The man gasped for air, and doubled over himself in pain. Before the crowd had time to react, a quick sidestep and a trained punch to the back of the head finished the job. The man unconscious before he touched the ground.

Erika took out the handkerchief from her stormcoat, wiped the man's snot from her cheek, and pet Tristan. "We'll be home soon, dear".

"FREEZE!"

Erika -- and the rest of the crowd -- looked up. Bright spotlights pierced the night, lighting Erika and the fallen man. They were shortly followed by two Arbites fliers making their way down to the scene.

It's about time. Erika thought. The crowd started dispersing with a distinct sense of urgency. The Arbites do that to the people. She sighed, and raised her hands. She didn't like to be kept waiting.

By the time the fliers had made it to ground, Erika, Tristan and the sprawled man were the only souls left on the street. The polished steel doors opened with a hiss of steam, and two figures stepped out of the vehicles.

"What's going on here?" said the first Arbites. Her voice denoted her as a woman, though it was hard to distinguish through her uniform's breastplate and black visor. She was pointing her stub gun towards Erika, and was followed by another, taller figure, holding a riot gun.

"Just doing your job, agent." Erika replied, hands still up. "I am Erika of House Belcroft. This man was spewing heresy and instilling disorder." and worse than that, he was in my way. TODO maybe this is too much. Erika lowered her head, directing the agent's eyes towards the house insignia etched on the breastpocket of her shirt. "May I show you my identification?"

The agent nodded, and Erika handed the guard her ID card.

"Major Erika Belcroft, Decoratian 25th infantry." Read the officer. She handed the documents to her partner. "Check the records, Igor". And the bulky figure stepped back towards the fliers. She turned back to Erika, still pointing her gun towards her -- "Now, don't move. Neither of us wants this to go bad"

"Of course, officer." Said Erika. Tristan dropped from his perch with a clang and fixed his eyes on the agent's visor. "Don't worry, he's harmless."

"ID checks out!" shouted the tall man. The female Arbites let out a sigh of relief, and her body became visibly relaxed. She holstered her gun and slid her visor up, revealing a tired young face. There was a fierce determination behind the exhaustion in her eyes.

"We're going to need you to come with us, for questioning."

"I'm afraid I can't do that." Said Erika, lowering her hands and kneeling to pet Tristan. "What's your name, officer?"

"Derida Minsk," Said the officer, " and I'm afraid I must insist, Mamzel Belcroft. This incident falls under an active investigation for the Ministorum, and we need everything we can get."

Now, that's interesting. Is this not an isolated incident?

"Enforcer Minsk, I commend your diligence. However, I'm expected at House Belcroft this evening, and I'm never late. You know my name, and therefore you know you can't forcibly arrest me. Furthermore, this is an active investigation, so you can imagine what happened, and you know that I didn't do anything wrong, and I was acting in self-defense. You're going to have to let this one go." Minsk remained impassible, but Erika's augmetic left eye caught her teeth, gritting in frustration.

Erika stopped petting Tristan and stood up, addressing the Enforcer directly. "However, I do not want to stand in the way of our dear Enforcers. So, now that I have your name, I give you my word that I will visit you soon, to provide what aid I can."

This was the best Minsk was going to get, and they both knew it. Erika could make a lot more trouble for Minsk that this case ever could. The Enforcer sighed, defeated.

"Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to be on my way." Said Erika, turning towards the now empty street. "Tristan, up!" She took a deep breath, feeling the night's chill fill her lungs. She could make out the outline of the Grand Archive in the distance, at the other end of Viam Victoria. Belcroft House was not far from there.

"See you soon!" She said to the Minsk, who had already started loading the man's inert body in her flier.

She adjusted her coat around her shoulders, checked her power estoc and lasgun as force of habit, petted Tristan's head, now perched on her right shoulder, and started walking down the street.

It's good to be back.
