Erika hadn't expected _that_ when she approached the crowd. 

She might have expected a firedrinker making his show, or even a few Arbites beating one of those street rats after catching them stealing, while everyone was busy wathing the firedrinker show. But not _that_.

She had seen raving fanatics before, for sure, but none of them right outside the civilian port of Decorat. Arching an eyebrow, she admitted to herself that this man had managed to surprise _her_.

She didn't have the patience for this right now. She was itching to get back to her family home after such a long time on the frontlines.

The bodies of passersby were starting to pack tighter and tighter -- too curious to continue with their day, but too scared to move into the circle, within the man's reach.

_No Arbites in sight_. She sighed. She would have to do something about this herself.

"Tristan, up!" The cat's mechanical legs whirred as it sprung up, seamlessly locking in the harness of her right shoulder.

With the cat safely perched on her back, Erika waded through the crowd to the edge of the clearing.

"Sir, in the name of House Belcroft, I'm going to need you to calm down and shut up." Said Erika, as she popped out of the wall of pedestrians less graciously than she'd hoped.
