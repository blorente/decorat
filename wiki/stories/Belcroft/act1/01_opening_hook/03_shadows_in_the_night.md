Rien started to get annoyed on his way to the station. By the time he got on the empty midnight tram to the Grids, he was angry. As he stepped out of the train into the deserted station, he was fuming.

_Two weeks! Two weeks I'd been following that ninker, and she comes off that big ship all fancy, and gets him arrested in two seconds! Didn't even get to ask his frakking name! Then I follow her, and that dimwit cat of hers tells her._

Rien punctuated his words with a kick to the station's wall.

"Frek!" That hurt. The pain helped him focus. Rien took a deep breath. "Calm down, Rien. Steady hands, just like she taught you."

He looked around, adjusting his eyes to the lower levels of light. The tram ran all throughought the hive, so it was well lit. But here, down in the Grid, it was a different story.

_Huh. I wonder how long that's been there. They should get that fixed._ Then he stopped, and chuckled. He had spent too much time uphive, we was turning posh. He shook his head, continuing towards the lights of the Grid.

As he approached the giant wall of hab-blocks, he started looking for the usual faces in the usual spots. The Grids were usually quiet at night, but one could still see the facade peppered with small groups of people sharing a smoke and the news of the day. In fact, one could see almost everything that was happening outside of the cramped hab-blocks;
