Rien started to get annoyed on his way to the station. By the time he got on the empty midnight tram to the Grids, he was angry. As he stepped out of the train into the deserted station, he was fuming.

_Two weeks! Two weeks I'd been following that ninker, and she comes off that big ship all fancy, and gets him arrested in two seconds! Didn't even get to ask his frakking name! Then I follow her, and that dimwit cat of hers tells her._

Rien punctuated his words with a kick to the station's wall.

"Frek!" That hurt. The pain helped him focus. Rien took a deep breath. "Calm down, Rien. Steady hands, just like she taught you."

He looked around, adjusting his eyes to the lower levels of light. The tram ran all throughought the hive, so it was well lit. But here, down in the Grid, it was a different story. The station had no roof. It was a single, long stretch of flat rockrete, lit by a strip of cold, flickering lights. The lack of shelter wasn't usually a problem during the day -- rush hour brought in more than enough people to fight off even the harshest of winter mornings --, but right now Rien was feeling the winter cold soak to his bones. Still, he thanked the Emperor that nobody was in the station to see his outburst. 

With a slight limp to avoid overbearing his toe, Rien headed towards one of the metallic bridges that connected the station with the lumbering mass of the Grid. As his boots clanged their way across the bridge, he saw that one of the guardrails was broken. Rien wondered if it was the result of some poor soul falling. It was a long way down from Level 150, West Cuadrant. 

_Huh. I wonder how long that's been there. They should get that fixed._ Then he stopped, and chuckled. He had spent too much time uphive, we was turning posh. He shook his head, continuing towards the lights of the Grid.

As he approached the giant wall of hab-blocks, he started looking for the usual faces in the usual spots. The Grids were usually quiet at night, but one could still see the facade peppered with small lights coming from the small windows on the hab doors. In fact, from where Rien was, one could see almost everything that was happening outside of the cramped hab-blocks: The small groups of people quietly sharing a smoke and the news of the day. The people marching to the communal bathrooms looking for late night relief. The teenagers, sneaking out to meet with their friends or lovers. The people here didn't have much, Rien felt more at home than he had all day, pursuing the madman through the upper hive. Even the smog felt somehow easier to breathe.

Rien was pondering this as he made his way up the stairs to his hab in Level 158, when a familiar voice called his name.

"Hey, kid! What'cha up to this late at night?"

Rien looked to his right. Lucitav was making signs from his chair. Rien approached the man, smiling. 

"Not much, Lucy. Just wanted to see the sky is all" Lucitav wouldn't buy today's excuse either, and Rien knew that already. He'd even made a game out of it, every night trying to come up with a wilder excuse than the last. Lucy wasn't smiling.

"You know I don't like you messing with the upper crusters. Nothing good can come out of it. You should focus on doing good at Constanza's, and leave the big problems for the big wigs." That speech, on the other hand, didn't change at all from night to night.

"I know, Lucy. Don't worry old man, I can cover my ass." _and it's not like I have a choice, anyway_.

"Don't call me old man, you ninker!" He wasn't really that old, barely hitting 40. But 40 years were a long time in the Grids, and more for someone with Lucitav's life. Plus, Rien loved to tease him about it. "You better be right about covering your ass, otherwise you'll end up like... like..."

Lucitav lowered his voice, and then his eyes. Rien felt a pang of guilt in the chest for picking on the man. _Like Moira_, he thought. A silence fell on the balcony and they both looked outside, to the cascade of lights that was Decorat's nightlife, letting the seconds pass. Remembering.

"I'm sorry, Lucy. I'll be careful, I promise."

"You better be, kid. You better be." Said Lucitav, his eyes still fixed on the millions of lights before them. "I'm tired, I'm going to bed. You have a good night, and tell your sister I say hi." He said. He got up, using his crutches to make up for his missing right leg. The door to his hab slid open with a hiss and a clang, and the broken man limped inside.

"Good night, old man" Rien said, trying to lighten the mood.

Lucitav chuckled drily, and the door to his hab slid closed.

Rien climbed two more floors and walked left until he got to Hab Block 1337, Level 158. _Home_. He took a deep breath, preparing himself for what came next.

Fortunately, she was still sleeping. Rien entered the hab, quietly taking his shoes off. He moved sideways, in the space between their bed and the left wall. He was so focused on stealth that his left foot bumped on the chair, dropping some of her medicine bottles to the floor, with a loud thud. 

"Frek!" He exclaimed, pain flaring from his toes up his thigh. That was the foot he'd stubbed earlier. Cel groaned, stirred and turned, taking the bedsheets with her. Heart pounding, Rien stood perfectly still, counting to ten.

Trying not to make a sound that would disturb his sister's peace, Rien bent over to pick up the fallen vial. _Thank the Emperor, it's still intact._ Rien thought. The last thing he needed was to have to go buy another dose. One last look at Cel told him that it was probably safe to move again, and he started moving his way towards the sink, this time looking at where he was going.

When he got to the
