Shadows in the night
--------------------

Rien started to get annoyed on his way to the station. By the time he got on the empty midnight tram to the Grids, he was angry. As he stepped out of the train into the deserted station, he was fuming.

_Two weeks! Two weeks I'd been following that ninker, and she comes off that big ship all fancy, and gets him arrested in two seconds! Didn't even get to ask his frakking name! Then I follow her, and that dimwit cat of hers tells her._

Rien punctuated his words with a kick to the station's wall.

"Frek!" That hurt. The pain helped him focus. Rien took a deep breath. "Calm down, Rien. Steady hands, just like she taught you."

He looked around, adjusting his eyes to the lower levels of light. The tram ran all throughought the hive, so it was well lit. But here, down in the Grid, it was a different story. The station had no roof. It was a single, long stretch of flat rockrete, lit by a strip of cold, flickering lights. The lack of shelter wasn't usually a problem during the day -- rush hour brought in more than enough people to fight off even the harshest of winter mornings --, but right now Rien was feeling the winter cold soak to his bones. Still, he thanked the Emperor that nobody was in the station to see his outburst. 

With a slight limp to avoid overbearing his toe, Rien headed towards one of the metallic bridges that connected the station with the lumbering mass of the Grid. As his boots clanged their way across the bridge, he saw that one of the guardrails was broken. Rien wondered if it was the result of some poor soul falling. It was a long way down from Level 150, West Cuadrant. 

_Huh. I wonder how long that's been there. They should get that fixed._ Then he stopped, and chuckled. He had spent too much time uphive, we was turning posh. He shook his head, continuing towards the lights of the Grid.

As he approached the giant wall of hab-blocks, he started looking for the usual faces in the usual spots. The Grids were usually quiet at night, but one could still see the facade peppered with small lights coming from the small windows on the hab doors. In fact, from where Rien was, one could see almost everything that was happening outside of the cramped hab-blocks: The small groups of people quietly sharing a smoke and the news of the day. The people marching to the communal bathrooms looking for late night relief. The teenagers, sneaking out to meet with their friends or lovers. The people here didn't have much, Rien felt more at home than he had all day, pursuing the madman through the upper hive. Even the smog felt somehow easier to breathe.

Rien was pondering this as he made his way up the stairs to his hab in Level 158, when a familiar voice called his name.

"Hey, kid! What'cha up to this late at night?"

Rien looked to his right. Lucitav was making signs from his chair. Rien approached the man, smiling. 

"Not much, Lucy. Just wanted to see the sky is all" Lucitav wouldn't buy today's excuse either, and Rien knew that already. He'd even made a game out of it, every night trying to come up with a wilder excuse than the last. Lucy wasn't smiling.

"You know I don't like you messing with the upper crusters. Nothing good can come out of it. You should focus on doing good at Constanza's, and leave the big problems for the big wigs." That speech, on the other hand, didn't change at all from night to night.

"Don't worry old man, I can cover my ass." _and it's not like I have a choice, anyway_.

"Don't call me old man, you ninker!" He wasn't really that old, barely hitting 40. But 40 years were a long time in the Grids, and more for someone with Lucitav's life. Plus, Rien loved to tease him about it. "You better be right about covering your ass, otherwise you'll end up like... like..."

Lucitav lowered his voice, and then his eyes. Rien felt a pang of guilt in the chest for picking on the man. _Like Moira_, he thought. A silence fell on the balcony and they both looked outside, to the cascade of lights that was Decorat's nightlife, letting the seconds pass. Remembering.

"I'm sorry, Lucy. I'll be careful, I promise."

"You better be, kid. You better be." Said Lucitav, his eyes still fixed on the millions of lights before them. "I'm tired, I'm going to bed. You have a good night, and tell your sister I say hi." He said. He got up, using his crutches to make up for his missing right leg. The door to his hab slid open with a hiss and a clang, and the broken man limped inside.

"Good night, old man" Rien said, trying to lighten the mood.

Lucitav chuckled drily, and the door to his hab slid closed.

Rien climbed two more floors and walked left until he got to Hab Block 1337, Level 158. _Home_. He took a deep breath, preparing himself for what came next.

Fortunately, she was still sleeping when the hab door slid open. Rien entered the hab, quietly taking his boots off. He moved sideways, feeling the cold rockrete in the space between their bed and the left wall. He was so focused on stealth that his left foot bumped on the chair, dropping some of her medicine bottles to the floor with a loud thud. 

"Frek!" He exclaimed, pain flaring from his toes up his calf. That was the foot he'd stubbed earlier. Cel groaned, stirred and turned, taking the bedsheets with her. Heart pounding, Rien stood perfectly still, counting to ten.

Trying not to make a sound that would disturb his sister's peace, Rien bent over to pick up the fallen vial. _Thank the Emperor, it's still intact._ Rien thought. The last thing he needed was to have to go buy another dose. One last look at Cel told him that it was probably safe to move again, and he started making his way towards the sink, this time looking at where he was going.

Rien let out his breath when he finally got to the other end of the room, realizing that he had been holding it since the incident with the chair. He yawned, and started changing into his night clothes.

He hadn't even removed his jacket when Cel sprung up, screaming.

"No! No, no! Get away!" screamed Cel, as she sat upright, covering her face with her hands.

Rien rushed to her side.

"Shh, Cel. It's me, I'm here" He said, putting his arms around her shoulders. Rien could feel her sister's cold sweat on her warm skin, and -- most worrying of all -- her heart pumping wildly.

"Get away!" Cel's hands were waving wildly in the air now fighting an invisible foe. Her eyes were wide open, bloodshot, looking with fear at something that wasn't there. Rien held her tighter. Cel was older and stronger than him, but he refused to let go.

"It's me, Cel. It's Rien. You're safe, you're with me".

Seconds passed, then minutes. Eventually, slowly, Rien started feeling Cel's body relax. Her eyes started coming into focus, and her breathing became more regular.

"Is it... you, Rien?" Her voice sounded tired, like a TODO metaphor.

"I'm here, Cel." Rien let go of his sister and sat beside her on the unmade bed, giving her space to breath.

"I've had another dream." She said. She was on the brink of tears.

"Yeah..." That wasn't what Cel needed to hear, but it was the best Rien could do right now. His eyes fixed on the tiny patch of uncluttered space left on the floor of the hab. The nightmares were getting worse, and they came more frequently now. He didn't know how much longer Cel could keep this up. Frik -- He didn't know how long _he_ would be able to keep it up.

Cel looked at him, and her expression changed instantly. She wiped her eyes with her arm and sprang up the bed, making the rusty springs creak.

"Terra! You must be hungry, Ry!" she said in a cheerful tone. "Let me make us some dinner. What do you say to a couple of bricks?" 

Rien didn't really know what bricks were made of, but he started feeling better when Cel started frying a cuple on the small stovetop. He hadn't realized how hungry he was until the smell started filling the room, but now his stomach was rumbling.

Cel turned around shortly, two steaming plated in hand. "Make some room, will you?"

Rien sprang into action. He cleared the chair moving the medicine to the small shelf above the bed, made the bed and sat down, all in a matter of seconds. Cel passed him a plate, and they started eating.

"What were you doing out so late, anyway?" said Cel after a while.

"Following that ninker from the other day." said Rien. Bits of brick jumped out of his mouth "I --"

"Don't talk with your mouth full, Ry" said Cel without lifting her gaze off her plate.

"-- Sorry" Rien gulped. "I followed him all the way uphive, to the port, but he started making a scene, and this lady knocked right out. She looked military, but she was dressed all fancy. I think she was a noble or something. She wasn't afraid of the Enforcers."

"Wait, back up. You went uphive? To the port?"

"Yeah"

"Ry, were you careful?" she said, with more than a note of worry in her voice.

"Well, I thought I was. I didn't think anyone had seen me, but when I tried to follow that lady, her cat told her where I was."

"Her cat?" Cel turned to him, interested.

"Yeah, she had a cat some neat augmetics. That lady has money, I tell you. I was scared for a moment there, but she wasn't interested in a Gridder like me."

"Huh. Fancy that." Cel went back to her plate and continued eating. "And then what happened?"

"Then I came back! I saw old Lucy on his chair, he gave me the usual speech"

"He's right, you know." said Cel, putting down her empty plate and looking at Rien. "I don't like these escapades either. I'm worried about you."

"Well, we don't have a better plan" Rien shrugged. "Until we know what's going on with you, I'm going to keep looking. You didn't see how that man was, but I'm not letting you go nuts like that." Rien looked at Cel. Something she saw in his eyes made her expression soften.

"I'm sorry to put you through this, brother." 

"That's okay" said Rien, with all the sincerity his tired face could muster. "you'd do the same for me". 

Rien got up and picked the plates, making Cel understand that he was done talking about it.

"You better get some rest" he said, signalling the bed. 

"Leave that, I'll wash it tomorrow" said Cel, lying on the bed.

"Don't worry, I got it" said Rien, dropping the dishes in the sink.

"As okay, suit yourself" Cel was half asleep already.

When he was done washing the dishes, Rien reached up to the shelf, looking for the small vial. His shoulders sunk as he collapsed on the chair, exhausted.

He loaded the needle with the sedative, and he went to sleep hoping he wouldn't have to use it that night.
