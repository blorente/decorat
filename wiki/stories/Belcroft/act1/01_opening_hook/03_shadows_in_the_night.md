Rien started to get annoyed on his way to the station. By the time he got on the empty midnight tram to the Grids, he was angry. As he stepped out of the train into the deserted station, he was fuming.

_Two weeks! Two weeks I'd been following that ninker, and she comes off that big ship all fancy, and gets him arrested in two seconds! Didn't even get to ask his frakking name! Then I follow her, and that dimwit cat of hers tells her._

Rien punctuated his words with a kick to the station's wall.

"Frek!" That hurt. The pain helped him focus. Rien took a deep breath. "Calm down, Rien. Steady hands, just like she taught you."

He looked around, adjusting his eyes to the lower levels of light. The tram ran all throughought the hive, so it was well lit. But here, down in the Grid, it was a different story. The station had no roof. It was a single, long stretch of flat rockrete, lit by a strip of cold, flickering lights. The lack of shelter wasn't usually a problem during the day -- rush hour brought in more than enough people to fight off even the harshest of winter mornings --, but right now Rien was feeling the winter cold soak to his bones. Still, he thanked the Emperor that nobody was in the station to see his outburst. 

With a slight limp to avoid overbearing his toe, Rien headed towards one of the metallic bridges that connected the station with the lumbering mass of the Grid. As his boots clanged their way across the bridge, he saw that one of the guardrails was broken. Rien wondered if it was the result of some poor soul falling. It was a long way down from Level 150, West Cuadrant.
