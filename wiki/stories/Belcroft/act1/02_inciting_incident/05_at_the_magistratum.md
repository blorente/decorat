At the magistratum
------------------

Enforcer Valya Minsk yawned, sipped her caffeine, and went back to typing. Her desk, full of last night's paperwork, was just one of the hundreds of identical tables covering the fifth floor of the Enforcer headquarters. But she had choosen the position very carefully. From her vantage point at the end of the room, she had seen the noblewoman storm into the office. She had also seen how she talked with reception, and they pointed her towards her desk.  She had chosen a good desk. Now, she had time to prepare her questions, and dispatch that pompous ninker as quickly as possible.

"I always keep my promises, agent Minsk" said Erika, as she sat down on the worn plastek chair. In front of her, Valya lifted her eyes from the mountain of papers she was handling, and tried very hard to smile.

Valya took a moment to read her witness. _Long, gray stormcoat, military issue. House insignia etched on the left breastpocket, officer chevrons on the right. Standard issue laspistol, and -- is that a power estoc? definitely not standard issue, must be a family heirloom. Well, here we go._, thought the Enforcer. _At least she hasn't brought the cat_.

"Hello to you too. I didn't think you'd turn up, Major. What a nice surprise. I would ask you to sit, but I see you've already made yourself at home."

"I have." said Erika, crossing her legs and staring intently. It was hard to see the night before, but now Valya could clearly distinguish the scar along the major's TODO left/right eye. _How does someone get a scar like that and keep the eye?_

"Let's get straight to it then, I won't waste any more of your time" _or mine._ "I'm going to ask you some questions," Vanya took the vox recorder from one of her drawers "And I will record this conversation. For archival purposes.", and pressed a button.

"Please state your name and title"

"Erika Belcroft, Major of the 105th Decoratian Infantry"

Valya brought up a pict of last night's assailant in her dataslate, and showed it to Erika.

"Do you recognize this man?"

"It's the drunk that attacked me. I hadn't seen him before."

_Drunk? If only she knew..._

"Where did that happen?"

"Right outside of Portum Major."

"Why were you outside of Portum Major last night, at 11:30?"

"I was returning home from the frontlines"

_That's interesting. Nobody returns from the frontlines, not before retiring._

"And what brings you back from the frontline so soon, Major Belcroft?"

"I don't see how that pertains the investigation, _Enforcer_."

Valya could see the Major tense up. _That hit a nerve. I have to be careful_.

"I'm afraid I am the one who decides what is or isn't pertinent, Major. One never knows what might be vital information."

"Then I fear you'll have to go empty-handed for a little longer. That information is classified." said Erika, smiling.

_Frek! She's called my bluff. She knows I can't check that without a permit. IÂ´ll have to try something else._

"Describe the incident, please."

"I was making my way home, when I saw the crowd gathered around this man. He was drunk, insulting the people around him."

"And where would _home_ be?"

"House Belcroft, of course. Tenth house of the Spires."

"I hear Lord Belcroft hasn't been seen for a while. How is your father doing?" Was that a flash of doubt Valya saw pass over Belcroft's face? It was so brief that the agent wondered if she had seen anything at all.

"My father is well, thank you. The passing of my dear mother has left him indisposed, for the time being."

"Indisposed for years, Major?" This time, Valya was sure -- Belcroft had flinched. Briefly, but clearly.

"We all process guilt diffently, agent. Surely you won't blame a man for taking the time to properly mourn his dead wife." The noble's face remained calm and unreadable.

"Besides, I'm sure you have more important questions to ask. Questions that actually pertain the incident you've brought me here to discuss."

Valya realized that she was leaning forward on the table, fists clenched. She took a second to compose herself, and reclined back on her chair.

"Of course. Please continue your recount of the incident"


"He called me _girl_." said Major Belfort with a chuckle, as if nothing had happened. "As I've told you last night, I tried to reason with him first. The man wouldn't listen, and attacked me instead. I was forced to take him out, and wait until you fine agents arrived."

Valya looked straight into Erika's eyes, and let the crushing silence take over for a few seconds.

Erika paused briefly. "Would that be all, agent Minsk?"

Valya sighed, defeated. She didn't think she would get anything else from her. Much to Valya's despair, Erika Belfort seemed to have broken into her investigation by genuine accident. Something about her and her father felt wrong, but she had nothing to keep her locked up.

"There is one more thing. Where can we find you, in case we have further questions?"

"I will be at home, as usual. I trust you know where that is."

"We do." said Valya. "Please stay within the bounds of Decorat at all times. That will be all, Lady Belfort. The Departamento Monitorum thanks you for your cooperation." Valya turned the device off.

Erika got up from the chair, straightening her long storm coat.

"Thank you, agent Minsk. I truly enjoyed our conversation."

_She looks... sincere._

As she was turning to leave, Erika gave her and her desk one last look. "You know?" she said "I have a feeling you would make a great member of the Scholam, if you're ever interested. I look forward to meeting you again."

And, with that, she turned and walked the way she'd come. Minsk let out a sigh. There was something about the Major -- she had a secret, Valya had no doubt about it. But that would have to wait -- she had a case to crack.
