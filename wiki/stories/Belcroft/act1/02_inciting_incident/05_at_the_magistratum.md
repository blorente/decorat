At the magistratum
------------------

Enforcer Valya Minsk yawned, sipped her caffeine, and went back to her paperwork. Her desk was just one of the hundreds of identical tables covering the fifth floor of the Enforcer headquarters, but she had choosen the position very carefully. From her vantage point at the end of the room, she had seen that noblewoman storm into the office. She had seen how she talked with reception, and they pointed her towards her desk.  She had chosen a good desk. Now, she had time to prepare her questions, and dispatch that pompous ninker as quickly as possible.

"I always keep my promises, agent Minsk" said Erika, as she sat down on the worn plastek chair. In front of her, Valya lifted her eyes from the mountain of papers she was handling, and tried very hard to smile. _Here we go_, thought the Enforcer.

"Hello to you too. I didn't think you'd turn up, Major. What a nice surprise. I would ask you to sit, but I see you've already made yourself at home."

"I have." said Erika, crossing her legs and staring intently. It was hard to see the night before, but now Valya could clearly distinguish the scar along the major's TODO left/right eye. _How does someone get a scar like that and keep the eye?_

"Let's get straight to it then, I won't waste any more of your time" _or mine._ "Let's get started." Vanya took the vox recorder from one of her drawers "this conversation will be recorded", and pressed a button.

"Please state your name and title"

"Erika Belcroft, Major of the 105th Decoratian Infantry"

"Why were you outside of Portum Major last night, at 11:30?"

"I was returning home from the frontlines"

_That's interesting. Nobody returns from the frontlines, not before retiring._

Valya brought up a pict of the assailant in her dataslate, and showed it to Erika.

"Do you recognize this man?"

"It's the drunk that attacked me"

// Valya starts suspecting Erika's father, and conversation gets tense.
// Erika has recorded everything with her augment, and then analyzes the footage, finds the person's address.
