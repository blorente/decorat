- **Scene:** Finding out about the sickness.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Deciding to visit the man's house later that night, Erika goes to the Archive, to find out everything she can about the sickness. We get to see preparations for the data input rites. An Admech adept takes her to one of the higher up consultorum, very lavish with lots of velvet and leather. Nobody else is there. She starts looking for information regarding the three names. Some of it is classified, but some other has been accessed recently (she can tell by the loadtime). She then stops searching for that, and instead searches for the name of Faustus. She finds records of his last breakdown, and how he was reset, but deemed unable to work, a few years back. She gets the man's last known address. On her way out, She crosses paths with Inquisitor Ozmund Trygon, who is also just leaving He must have gotten in before her, because the other booths were empty. They exchange a few words, the Inquisitor is perfectly cordial, and he even mentions that he found his queries faster to answer than usual, looking at Erika.
    - **The Consequence:** Erika determines to go to Faustus' house.
    - **Subplots:** The Inquisitor starts suspecting Erika, based on the timing of the queries. Not a lot, just curious.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Erika finds out the address of the man, and goes to investigate.
    - **The realization:** The inquisition is on the case -- That's a whole nother ballgame, and the pressure is on.
  - **Setup for next scene:**
