//TODO Need to add a little small talk to the inquisitor, something that seems off topic but it comes back, like the opening of inglorious basterds.

Querying the Grand Archive
--------------------------

Erika stood at the open gates of the Grand Archive. She hadn't been there since her days as a cadet in the Scholam, but she could still remember the faint smell of leather, combined with the static from the Cognitors below. Around her, streams of business owners, administrative officials, and even the odd military type trickled in and out of the open doors, performing their 

The Grand Archive, the pearl of Decorat, stood at the end of Viam Victoria in the upper hive, serving almost as a facade to the Spires, where houses like Belcroft and Riven governed the hive. The building itself was surprisingly ancient, one of the first built in Decorat, when it was established ten millenia ago, before the Great Treason. Erika remembered that this was only the front to the real value of the archive. Below ground, millions of databanks were kept in climate-controlled vaults that ran all through the height of the spire, like a backbone. Inside those vaults was knowledge aquired, classified and stored over thousands of generations.

From where she stood, Erika could also see the stained-glass windows depicting various episodes of the great crusade, and even some scenes of the Great Treason. One in particular caught her attention: The sacrifice of Ollanius Pius. As the legend tells, Guardsman Ollanius stood between our beloved Emperor and the Traitor Horus at the last stages of the Siege of Terra. His valor and devotion bought the Emperor the few crucial moments he needed to regain his strength and banish Horus, forever.

_With ten like him, and I could finish the //TODO war in a decade._ It was a pity there wasn't even one like him in her whole company.

She banished those thoughts from her mind -- She was here for information. Before her, the doors to the greatest knowledge repository of the //TODO subsector stood open, inviting her to find answers to the questions of her father's illness.

She joined the people going in and out of the building, eager to get started.


"MILITIA CLEARANCE: APPROVED. THIS WAY, PLEASE" said the Adept, waving towards one of the  the upper floors. He was covered in the typical mechanicum red robes, but his figure ended where his hips would have been. Instead of legs, his body terminated in a metallic disc that dislodged from the pillar he was resting on, and started hovering towards the stairs. 

Erika followed the robbed figure, entering the upper corridors of the Archive. Her boots barely made a sound on the carpet-covered floor. The ceilings were covered ornately etched wood, and the walls were lined with enormous paintings depicting glorious battles and holy acts. The Adept arrived at a small wooden door at the end of the hallway, etched with a big, mechanical 5:

"WE HAVE ARRIVED. COGNITOR CONSOLE ROOM 5." He opened the door. "MAY YOU FIND ANSWERS TO YOUR QUERIES."

The Interface Room was empty, except for the four Cognitor Consoles arranged in a circle, in the middle. Erika signalled Tristan to step off her shoulder, and sat down in one of the leather armchairs. The glyphs of the console came to life when she touched the command interface: 

```
-> ID> Erika M. Belcroft, 29347-M

Welcome, Erika.

Erika paused for a moment. Let's start with something easy:

```
Please state your query:
-> Faustus Dorm.
Searching databanks... Done.
Gathering results... Done.
Found 177,432 results in 5,324,155,790 records. Clearance //TODO administratum
Filtering operations enabled.
```

Erika remembered her training. She hadn't used a Cognitor Console since her days in the Scholam, but she had spent enough hours doing research to etch the commands into her muscle memory. With a few taps of the keys, she arrived at the man she was looking for. She pulled the datasheet. It had been updated ten years ago, in the last data entry.

```
Citizen Profile:
- Name: Faustus Dorm
- Date of Birth: //TODO date of birth
- Last Known Address: //TODO address
- Last Known Position: Unemployed, due to faulty reset.
- Prior Ocupations:
  - Congitor Retriever, Clearance ORDOS.
  - Congitor Retriever, Clearance POPULO.
```

The story was common enough: A Gridder gets promoted to ORDOS clearance, goes ballistic and gets one too many resets. _How does someone like that end up screaming obscenities on the street?_
Erika transferred the address to her eye's storage system, to follow up later. A couple of expert keypresses brought her back to a new search.

```
Please state your query:
-> //TODO daemon names
Searching databanks... Done.
Gathering results... Done.
Found 2 results in 45,998,676,738 records.
ERROR: Clearance insufficient.
```
It was a long shot anyway, but a shot worth taking. However, the failed query also gave her some information. _That was fast. Too fast._. Somebody had accessed these files recently, and the results had been saved in the temporary memory. _Agent Minsk is not the only one looking into this_ she thought. More people were looking for answers. People with more power, and more resources. Dangerous people.

With renewed impulse, Erika continued searching for anything that could help her father.

Several hours later, she didn't have much. She had found isolated cases of people suddenly having violent outburst dating many years back, but only a few had been properly catalogued, and none mentioned the same names that Faustus had been screaming.

Erika rubbed her eyes, tired after staring at the blinking glyphs for the better part of the day. A very bored Tristan seized this opportunity to climb on top of the console, demanding Erika's attention. She smiled, and started petting the cat.

"You're right, Tristan. We need a break" she said.

"You have a wise cat, Major Belcroft" said a voice frome the other side of the room.

Erika sprang up and looked in the direction the voice was coming from. A man was sitting in the Console opposite to Erika. He looked old, well in his sixties, but he must have been very quiet to slip into the room without Erika noticing. He was wearing simple black robes, with silver embroidery accenting the neck and cuffs. An Inquisitorial Rosette hung from his neck.

"Sorry to have startled you, Mamzel. Please excuse my rudeness. I've been admiring your  your furry companion and your furious dedication for quite a few moments now, and I was wondering which one would win." The man had a wide, benevolent smile on his face. "But where are my manners. Now that I've interrupted your cat's moment, I feel in need to make amends by introducing myself. Inquisitor Ozmund Trygon, at your service and the Throne's." The man make a flawless reverence.

"No need to apologize, Inquisitor. I am Major Erika, of House Belcroft."

"I knew that already, Mamzel. Once I recognized the insignia of House Belcroft on your coat, it wasn't hard to figure out who you were. Not many people return from their sacred duty to the Imperium before retirement."

Erika understood exactly what the Inquisitor was implying, but managed to hide the pin of fear that pierced the back of her neck.

"How observant. I wouldn't expect less from a member of the Ordo Hereticus." said Erika, managing a smile. Then, a thought occurred to her "Is that also why you bear no symbol?"

"That is exactly right! How refreshing to have a true partner for conversation. I wear no distinction salve this Rosette, for the only thing important about me is my eternal servitude to mankind and the Throne." He bowed again, unnecessarily. "A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mamzel Belcroft. I have learned all that I needed from here, so I must be going now. I'm sure our paths will cross again soon, and I await that opportunity eagerly. Please give my regards to your father." He bowed a third time, and exited the room.

As he walked out, Erika noticed that his steps were the steps of someone a lot younger, and a lot more agile. _And a lot more deadly_. She also noticed that he hadn't closed his session.

Erika walked around the room, and stared into the Console where the Inquisitor had been:

```
GOODBYE, MAMZEL BELCROFT.
Session Terminated.
```

_Frek! He did it on purpose!_ Erika took a deep breath to regain her composure. _I can't do anything about that now_, she thought. She recalled Faustus' address with her implant, and looked out of the big window. From her vantage point at the top of the tower of the archive, Erika saw the masses of Cognitors going in and out of shifts. Tides of people, moving between the Archive and the mag-trams that connected them to the lower levels.

"We must be going as well, Tristan" She said to the cat. Tristan jumped to her shoulder, and they started making their way to their flier.
