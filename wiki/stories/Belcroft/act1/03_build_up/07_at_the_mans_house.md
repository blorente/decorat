- **Scene:** At the man's house.

    - **What Happens:** 
    - **The Consequence:** Erika finds out about Constanza's, and learns who was following her.
    - **Subplots:** Rien talks to Erika for the first time, and realizes she's kind of a jerk. But he's headstrong, so he follows her anyway.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** We see the first establishing scenes of the relationship. We see how Erika treats Rien, and how Rien is too stubborn to give up. We see action escalate, raising hte stakes.
    - **The realization:** Erika sees the full effect of the madness. Erika realizes she's being followed.
  - **Setup for next scene:** She is headed to Costanza's
Erika arrives at Faustus' block. The door is closed, She enters, and finds the scribblings of a madman all across the wall. While she's studying it, she finds the butt of a lho stick. a couple of thugs with flamers get into the house. A fight ensues. It's clear Erika is going to win. Rien has followed her because he's stubborn and foolhardy. One of the thugs gets hold of him, and tries to bargain with Erika for the boy's life. Erika doesn't really care, until Rien screams something about him knowing something about the man (he has recognized the token for Constanza's). Erika sighs, and finds a way to dispatch the goons while keeping Rien alive. They have a conversation, Rien mentions that the man used to frequent Consntanza's, and asks to join Erika. "You've not given me anything but trouble, boy". Erika denies, gives (almost throws) him some money, and tells him to go away. He's in way over his head.

The Ravings on the Wall
-----------------------

"Decorat is great for many reasons, Tristan" Said Erika to the cat curled up in the passenger seat of her private flier. "But The Grids aren't one of them."

Below them, the cloud of smog approached them, signalling their entrance into the lower hive. Down there, the recycled air was mixed with exhaust from the cooling systems that kept the Archive's underground vault running. It was technically breathable, but not by much.

Not many people outside of the Munitorum had the luxury of fliers, so Erika had no problem following the mag-tram's tracks downhive.
