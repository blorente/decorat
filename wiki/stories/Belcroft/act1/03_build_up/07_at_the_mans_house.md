The Ravings on the Wall
-----------------------

"Decorat is great for many reasons, Tristan" Said Erika to the cat curled up in the passenger seat of her private flier. "But The Grids aren't one of them."

From the crystal dome of the flier's cabin, they could see the cloud of smog approaching them, signalling their entrance into the lower hive. Down there, the recycled air was mixed with exhaust from the cooling systems that kept the Archive's underground vault running. It was technically breathable, but not by much.

Not many people outside of the Munitorum had the luxury of fliers, so Erika had no problem following the mag-tram's tracks downhive. As she entered the clound of smog, Erika could see the top of the gigant pile of hab-blocks that formed the Grid. She realized that there was a problem she _did_ have. While every hab in the Grid fit perfectly with its neighbours, the Grid -- like Decorat's population -- was expanding. When one of the blocks malfunctioned, it was often easier to stack a new one on top of the Grid. This meant that new blocks were constantly being added to the top of the building.

It also meant that Erika had no place to land her flier. The top of the building was covered in half-built blocks, and she refused squarely to get to ground level. Not even the Gridders themselves went to that abandoned carcass of old habs. Erika cursed her luck _This is what I get for coming down to this dump_, she thought. She would have to be quick, and leave the engine running. Erika sighed, and started searcihing for //TODO Faustus address.

The seams of the crystal dome hissed in a cloud of steam, and the passenger cabin popped open. The first thing Erika noticed was the smell in the air. No, not the smell. The _texture_ of the air. Breathing felt odd down there, like liquid honey streaming through her nose.

Erika skipped to the chasis of her flier, hoping to not scratch the paint.  When she looked down, she saw the great pit of nothing the flier was hovering over. It was a long way down. Before her across the railguard,  there was a narrow passage connnecting all the habs. Beyond that passage, the stencil on the door indicated: //TODO Address.

"Let's see what we find, shall we dear?" She hopped gracefully over the railguard, onto the passage, and the cat followed suit.

To Erika's surprise, the door was closed but unlocked. The previous owner must have left in a hurry. "Well, Faustus, tell me your secrets" She said, pressing a button of the door's console.

The door hissed open, and both woman and cat crossed it threshold. Erika looked around, and her jaw dropped. She had seen many things. She had seen men die around her, cut down by alien beasts. Even before then, she had seen a thousand battles in the Scholam's training Cognitors. She had seen the horrors war had to offer. She had never seen anything like that.

The walls, the ceiling, the floor... even the window was fa sdovered with tiny red letters, forming paragraphs upon paragraphs of incoherent blabber. There were lines where “I am” were the only words, repeated from one end of the wall to the other. Lines where Faustus was apparently talking to someone named Jorrick, asking him to stop showing him. By the time the scribbles reached the ceiling, only three names were legible amid the sea of half-written letters: //TODO names.

"Holy Terra", she said, in awe. Not even in the most desperate of battles had Erika seen someone driven as mad as the frenzied script indicated Faustus had gone. "What can drive a man to this extreme?" She muttered, under her breath. A chilling thought crept through the back of her neck _Is this what awaits Father?_. She did not dare say that one out loud.sdf

Erika swallowed, and pushed the doubt out of her mind. She forced herself to focus, and took in the rest of the room. The entire hab took less space than her small closet. It could only be described as a narrow, short corridor of plascrete. A pile of dirty clothes covered what little floor space there was between the unmade bed and the filthy sink. Erika could swear there was a chair beneath all those red-stained shirts. The whole room smelled rank, like a towel that has been used too many times. The smoke of an unfinished lho-stick fogged the window above the sink.

Erika paused. An unfinshed lho-stick. She darted into action, moving herself to be flat against the door’s wall. She unholstered her standard issue lasgun with her left hand. Erika waved her head, and Tristan darted behind the pile of clothes, hidden from view. Erika waited for the owner of the lho stick to come back. Still. Expectant.

Not a miunte later, a figure darted through the door. Erika didn't waste a second. She grabbed the figure by the wrists and set her right foot forward at the same time. The figure lost balance and fell, face first, on the hard plascrete floor. She spun and dove, with the surgical precision of an expert combatant, and pressing her knee on the back of the figure's neck. She pointed her gun at the person's head.

"Who are you and what are you doing here, quick." Erika said.

"Wait! Don't shoot! Are you crazy?" That voice was... young. Much younger than Erika expected. She took a second look at the figure below her. Dressed in simple and worn blue worker clothes, the boy couldn't be much older than 16.

"Answer the question, boy. Give me a reason not to shoot."

"I'm the one that was following you! Remember? Last night? It was me! You knocked out my lead?" Said the boy. Erika remembered his terrible attempt at subterfuge, and eased the pressure of his neck. "I'm here to warn you. They're coming."

"Who is?" Erika said.

A loud bang followed. She barely managed to duck in time to dodge the round. She felt a sharp pain in her right hand, and dropped her lasgun.

Erika rolled forward, taking cover behind the bed. In the blink of an eye, her power-rapier was humming in her hand. She saw Tristan still hiding behind the pile of clothes, and connected her augmetic eye to the cat's.

There were three men standing between Erika and the door, dressed in lower-hive worker garbs. They were armed with long combat knives, and one of them was shooting at her with a stub gun. The other two were approaching the bed, encircling her. Through Tristan's eye, she saw the man adjust his aim, and shoot towards her crouching figure. The shots bounced off of the bed's solid frame, lodging themselves in the brittle walls. Erika had seen this before, and knew how it ended. She disconnected from Tristan, and waited.

After a few more rounds, the man stopped to reload. Erika seized that window, springing from the bed and rushing towards him. She ducked, slipping below the knife of the first man, and lurched forward. Her sword buzzed as it penetrated the chest of the shooter and lodged on the wall behind him, filling the tiny room with the smell of burnt flesh.

She turned around without wasting a second, ready to strike down another one of the men.

"Alright, let's all calm down!" said the third man. He was using the boy as a human shield, and was holding a knife to his throat. Erika stopped her blade, inches from the man's face. "Nobody has to get hurt, right Vince?"

"That's right, Carl" said the other man.

"You should have thought of that before shooting" Erika said, nodding towards the body pinned to the wall.

"That's probably true, but we got orders, you see. Now put the fancy glowknife out, or the boy gets it."

Erika evaluated the situation. Despite their clothes, the men didn't look like hive workers. She could see scars in their bare forearms and necks, and she could tell by their response to their compatriot's demise that they were no stranger to death. She could tell these men were serious. The boy, however, was another story. His face showed the stark surprise of someone who just realized they're in over their head. He was staring at her, his eyes pleading for help.

"Go ahead, be my guest" Erika said, shrugging. The boy's eyes opened, in horror.

"No! Wait! I knew the man that lived here! I know why you're here, I can help you!" he said.

_Now that's interesting_, thought Erika. She looked at Carl, then Vince, and finally the boy, evaluating how much she trusted his word. She sighed. "Fine." She powered off her sword, throwing it to the ground. "I yield." She would have to do this the hard way.

Carl smiled. "That's more like it. Now, on your knees."

As Erika and the boy kneeled side by side, Carl picked up his lho-stick from the sink, lighting it.

Vince picked up Erika's sword. "This is a fine piece ma'am." he said, turning on the family relic. _Bad mistake_, Erika thought, _shouldn't have touched that_.

"Now. We find ourselves in a bit of a pickle, wouldn't you say so, Vince?" Carl continued, going back to his fallen partner. He picked up the stub gun, and reloaded it with some rounds from the corpse. "You see, we were sent here to make sure that nobody could trace poor Faustus back to our boss. And here you both are, tracing Faustus back to our boss. Shouldn't have done that. So. What can we do now?" Carl pointed the gun at Erika.

"Well, I've got some ideas." Erika said. She made a head gesture, and Tristan's augmetic legs propelled him across the room. Before he could react, Carl was hit by sixty pounds of steel and fur, toppling him to the floor. The gun's threat removed, Erika tackled Vince, impaling him with her own sword. She turned to Carl. The man's screams were mixed with a gurgling sound. Tristan's adamantium claws had opened a deep gush in the man's neck, and blood was pouring out onto the floor. Erika ended the man's suffering with an expert cut.

As Carl's last spasms died down, silence creeped into the hab-block. Erika turned to the boy. He was trembling, not quite sure how to react to what he had just seen. Erika remembered the first times she had seen death, during her trainings in the Scholam, and almost took pity on him. She picked her weapons.

"Are you hurt?" She asked.

"No I'm... fine, I think." The boy answered, eyes fixed on the mess of Carl's neck.

"They would have killed us." She said matter-of-factly.

"I know. There's just so much... blood."

"I suggest you look away, boy." Her patience was wearing thin. "You said you could help me. Go on, then. Show me that I didn't risk my neck for nothing."

The boy shook his head, and stared at Erika. There was fear in his eyes. "I lied. I don't know anything about this man. You got him arrested before I could even learn his name." He lowered his eyes, not daring to look at Erika's hardened stare "Please don't kill me."

Erika considered it. On the one hand, this boy had seen her, and could probably alert the authorities of what happened here. On the other hand, she had to admit that he had been pretty clever. She would have probably done something similar in his place, and she respected that. Plus, he probably had more to lose than her if he told the Enforcers. Erika sheatherd her sword.

"I'm not going to kill you." Tristan went over to her, and she pet his head. The boy looked at her, still tense. "I probably would have done the same. What's your name, boy?"

"I'm Rien" The boy started to relax.

"Get up, Rien" The boy got up, regaining some measure of confidence. "You need to stop following me. I can't have you pulling things like that, you're going to get us both killed. Why were you following me, anyway?"

The boy hesitated. "You took out my lead. I had been following that man for a while, and you just go and get him arrested. And then you show up, in your fancy bird, showing off all over the Grid. I thought maybe you knew something. I'd seen the men go in and out of this house, so I came in to warn you. I wasn't following you... This time."

Erika couldn't help but smile. She definitely wouldn't have done _that_. It was too foolhardy.

"That was a risky move, Rien. I could have killed you."

"I don't have a choice, ma'am." Rien looked straight into her eyes. Erika could see a fierce determination mixed with hope. "And judging by you coming down here to the Grids, I suspect that neither do you."

Erika stared at him, realizing what he was implying. _Poor boy_, she thuoght. She was sure that he also had someone... ill.

"I can't help you." She said. "I'm sorry." The boy lowered his stare, and Erika could see he was holding in tears. "But here, take this." She handed the boy a bar of credits "For your trouble."

"I don't want your money!" Rien said, raising his voice. "I want my sister back!" He said, tears running from his eyes. "Please, let me help you. I don't know what to do anymore."

Erika felt a ping of pain, but remained strong. "You would only hold me back, boy. I can't do this if I have to worry about you getting hurt. I'm sorry for your sister. Go home, and pray to the Emperor for her recovery."

Rien looked at her, hurt. Shoulders sunk, he walked out of the room, careful not to step on the pooling blood.

Erika stood there, thinking for a moment. She didn't feel good about leaving the boy behind, but she believed what she said. Whoever was behind this had sent three thugs like these to dispatch a crazy man's house. One didn't send that kind of force unless they something big to hide. That was no place for a boy.

Tristan miawed, and she snapped out of her musings. She started walking to the flier.
