    - **The Consequence:** Erika finds out about Constanza's, and learns who was following her.
    - **Subplots:** Rien talks to Erika for the first time, and realizes she's kind of a jerk. But he's headstrong, so he follows her anyway.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** We see the first establishing scenes of the relationship. We see how Erika treats Rien, and how Rien is too stubborn to give up. We see action escalate, raising hte stakes.
    - **The realization:** Erika sees the full effect of the madness. Erika realizes she's being followed.
  - **Setup for next scene:** She is headed to Costanza's
Erika arrives at Faustus' block. The door is closed, She enters, and finds the scribblings of a madman all across the wall. While she's studying it, she finds the butt of a lho stick. a couple of thugs with flamers get into the house. A fight ensues. It's clear Erika is going to win. Rien has followed her because he's stubborn and foolhardy. One of the thugs gets hold of him, and tries to bargain with Erika for the boy's life. Erika doesn't really care, until Rien screams something about him knowing something about the man (he has recognized the token for Constanza's). Erika sighs, and finds a way to dispatch the goons while keeping Rien alive. They have a conversation, Rien mentions that the man used to frequent Consntanza's, and asks to join Erika. "You've not given me anything but trouble, boy". Erika denies, gives (almost throws) him some money, and tells him to go away. He's in way over his head.

The Ravings on the Wall
-----------------------

"Decorat is great for many reasons, Tristan" Said Erika to the cat curled up in the passenger seat of her private flier. "But The Grids aren't one of them."

From the crystal dome of the flier's cabin, they could see the cloud of smog approaching them, signalling their entrance into the lower hive. Down there, the recycled air was mixed with exhaust from the cooling systems that kept the Archive's underground vault running. It was technically breathable, but not by much.

Not many people outside of the Munitorum had the luxury of fliers, so Erika had no problem following the mag-tram's tracks downhive. As she entered the clound of smog, Erika could see the top of the gigant pile of hab-blocks that formed the Grid. She realized that there was a problem she _did_ have. While every hab in the Grid fit perfectly with its neighbours, the Grid -- like Decorat's population -- was expanding. When one of the blocks malfunctioned, it was often easier to stack a new one on top of the Grid. This meant that new blocks were constantly being added to the top of the building.

It also meant that Erika had no place to land her flier. The top of the building was covered in half-built blocks, and she refused squarely to get to ground level. Not even the Gridders themselves went to that abandoned carcass of old habs. Erika cursed her luck _This is what I get for coming down to this dump_, she thought. She would have to be quick, and leave the engine running. Erika sighed, and started searcihing for //TODO Faustus address.

The seams of the crystal dome hissed in a cloud of steam, and the passenger cabin popped open. The first thing Erika noticed was the smell in the air. No, not the smell. The _texture_ of the air. Breathing felt odd down there, like liquid honey streaming through her nose.

Erika skipped to the chasis of her flier, hoping to not scratch the paint.  When she looked down, she saw the great pit of nothing the flier was hovering over. It was a long way down. Before her across the railguard,  there was a narrow passage connnecting all the habs. Beyond that passage, the stencil on the door indicated: //TODO Address.

"Let's see what we find, shall we dear?" She hopped gracefully over the railguard, onto the passage, and the cat followed suit.

To Erika's surprise, the door was closed but unlocked. The previous owner must have left in a hurry. "Well, Faustus, tell me your secrets" She said, pressing a button of the door's console.

The door hissed open, and both woman and cat crossed it threshold. Erika looked around, and her jaw dropped. She had seen many things. She had seen men die, She had seen the horrors war had to offer.
