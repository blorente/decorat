### Act 1: The Setup
#### Hook
- **Scene:** A drunk on the street.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika has just arrived at Decorat's main pedestrian port. With her personal effects and Tristan by her side, she's making her way towards her mansion. A commotion is forming on the street: A man is being aggressive and insulting the people around him. Doesn't look like there are arbites nearby. As Erika comes closer, the man lurches towards a random bystander, but Erika dispatches him quickly. She talks with the arbites, shows her badge, and is on her way.
    - **The Consequence:** Erika is on her way.
    - **Subplots:** Rien watches the whole thing, and is intrigued by Erika. He's also pissed, because he'd been following that man for a while. He starts following Erika.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Because Erika is faced for the first time with the chaos virus.
    - **The realization:** Fear that _this_ is the state that her father will be in.
  - **Setup for next scene:** Rien Starts following Erika. Erika notices.

- **Scene:** Arrival at the mansion.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika gets to the mansion, which is empty except for the family's butler TODO and the two servitors. She wants to see her father immediately, but the butler recommends that she wait until morning, with a grave face. She asks if anyone has come to visit since her father had fallen ill, and the butler reacts strongly.
    - **The Consequence:** She goes up to her room, talks with Tristan for a bit, and they both go to sleep.
    - **Subplots:** Rien has followed her to the mansion. Erika knows, but she thinks somebody wants to hurt her.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** She is getting even more scared (annoyed?). We get a chance to explore some of her motivations, maybe some of her past.
    - **The realization:** Her father is not just weirdly sick, but something else entirely. This will not do.
  - **Setup for next scene:** We can cut to Rien.

- **Scene:** Rien walks home
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Rien has followed the general to her mansion, and is fuming about her screwing up the man he'd been following for days.
    - **The Consequence:** Rien gets home, and we pan to his sister, exhibiting the same beginning traits of the same thing. He unties her (he had tied her up because he was scared she would escape), and there is dialogue.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** We get to see Rien's connection with his sister. For readers of the short story, they wonder what happened to her. We establish Rien's motivation for tailing the guy.
    - **The realization:** Maybe Erika can help him.
  - **Setup for next scene:** Rien is determined to go over and talk to Erika soon.

#### Inciting Incident
- **Scene:** Nightmares come alive.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika wakes up for TODO reason, and walks around the house. We hear some backstory while she introspects and watches the paintings. When passing through her father's studio, she hears someone shouting. 
    - **The Consequence:** She rushes to her father's study.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** We cement her as a smart, capable and fearless character. But also as a proud one, which is why her father's illness has hurt her so much.
    - **The realization:** She becomes resolute to not let the honor of her house fall. House Belcroft has served the Emperor for generations, and it won't stop now.
  - **Setup for next scene:** Sudden noise, and she rushes.

- **Scene:** Staring in the face of madness.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** She goes into the study, where her father is thrashing at things, very aggresive. Like the man on the street. She tries to reason with him, but he ends up lurching towards her, and she is forced to knock him out. She calls the butler, set her father to bed. 
    - **The Consequence:** She determines to go to the magistratum the following morning, to ask about the man on the harbor.
    - **Subplots:**
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** This is what will set in motion the adventure.
    - **The realization:** Erika realizes her father has the same thing as the man on the docks. She needs to investigate this, and make it better, in order to fix it for her father. 
  - **Setup for next scene:**

- **Scene:** At the magistratum
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika goes to the Magistratum. Using her influence, gets an audience with the people assigned to the case of the man yesterday. They tell her he's been charged with Heresy, and put in the arm.
    - **The Consequence:** Erika realized what I say in the realization. She makes an excuse and goes away.
    - **Subplots:** Rien has been following her, and 
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Sets Erika in motion for the rest of the novel. Going to the lowerhive is pretty uncomfortable for her.
    - **The realization:** Erika realizes that she's going to find things before the magistratum (to avoid revelaing her father's illness), and that she'll have to go to the Grids and the mid-lower hive to investigate.
  - **Setup for next scene:** She storms off, heading to her car, ready to take it to the lower hive.

- **Scene:** Meeting Rien
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika goes to her car, but Rien approaches her. They fight (using Tristan), until Erika sees that Rien is "just a boy". They talk, and Rien explains that she will need a guide. I think Rien doesn't tell Erika why he needs her help.
    - **The Consequence:** They go together to the underhive.
    - **Subplots:** Rien hides his real motivation, instead citing money.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Because we see the two characters interact. We see how Erika treats Rien, how he doesn't trust him, and how Rien hides his intetions. Erika sees he's scared. She may think it's of her, but it's actually of them discovering his sister.
    - **The realization:** Erika doesn't trust Rien, but she is forced to stick with him because he is obviously from the Grid.
  - **Setup for next scene:** They go to that man's house, which Rien knows how to get to.
