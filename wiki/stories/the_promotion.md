The Promotion
=============

Notes
-----

Promise: [Faustus](../people/operator_faustus.md) is small and insignificant. If he shows potential, the system will extract as much as it can out of him, even pushing him to an extreme, and discard him when he burns out. No matter how strong his devotion to the Emperor.

_Thump_. "Stop."

_Thump_. "No! Please, stop!"

_Thump_. "No!"
 
The smell of damp laundry opened his nostrils as the hab block shook with the passing tram.
Heart pumping, Faustus reached blindly across the room for his aquila necklace.

"The Emperor protects" - He uttered between breaths as he clutched the symbol to his bare chest.
    
He opened his eyes, trying to bring his breath back to a reasonable pace. The cracks of the window projected on the ceiling as the next tram passed. Faustus lied on his bed a little longer, letting the dancing lights take his mind away from the nightmare.

This was the worst one yet.

Eventually, his chest started to slow down. He started noticing his surroundings; the stains of sweat on the sheets, the boots of his upstairs neighbours getting ready for the day, and the metallic smell of blood.

That was new. He looked down at his hands. He grimaced with pain when he let go of the little bronze symbol. He had held on to it so strongly that he cut himself.

They were definitely getting worse. He hand't been able to get a good night's sleep for ages. Not since his `ThinkPod` reassignment.

"Don't be stupid!" - he thought - "The `ORDOS` clearance is a gift! It's a sign that the Emperor has noticed my purity! He is rewarding my faith!"
    
To think anything else would be heresy, would it not?

Still, some of the things he had to process were too much for anyone, even someone as pious as himself.

As the last echoes of the burning city dissipated from his mind, Faustus got up to get ready for work.
