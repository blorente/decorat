The Promotion
=============

Notes
-----

Promise: [Faustus](../people/operator_faustus.md) is small and insignificant. If he shows potential, the system will extract as much as it can out of him, even pushing him to an extreme, and discard him when he burns out. No matter how strong his devotion to the Emperor.

_thump_, _thump_, _thump_. "Stop."

_Thump_, _Thump_, _Thump_. "No! Please, stop!"

_THUMP_, _THUMP_, _THUMP_. "No!"

The smell of damp laundry opened my nostrils as the hab block shook with the passing mag-tram.
Heart pumping, I reached blindly across the room for the aquila necklace.

"The Emperor protects. The Emperor protects.", I uttered breathlessly as I clutched the symbol to my bare chest.
    
I opened my eyes, trying to bring my breath back to a reasonable pace. The cracks of the window projected on the ceiling as the carriages of the train carried its human cargo uphive. I lied on my bed a little longer, letting the dancing lights take my mind away from the nightmare.

This had been the worst one yet.

Eventually, my chest started to slow down. I started noticing my surroundings; the stains of sweat on the sheets, the boots of the upstairs neighbours getting ready for the day, and the metallic smell of blood.

"That's new."

I looked down at my hands. I'd been holding to the symbol too hard. It had left a deep cut in my the soft skin of my palm. With a grimace of pain, I let go of the little bronze symbol.

They were definitely getting worse. I hand't been able to get a good night's sleep for ages. Not since his ThinkPod reassignment.

Of course, that's a stupid thought. The ORDOS clearance is a gift, a sign that the Inquisition itself had noticed my diligence and skill. The promotion was a gift, and the Emperor would give me strength to bear any load it carried.
    
To think anything else would be heresy, would it not?

As the last echoes of the burning city dissipated from my mind, I got up to get ready for work.

The deeply warm smell of freshly brewed caffeine quickly filled the room, making the episode a few moments earlier seem like... well... a bad dream. I brought the warm cup to my lips with a bandadged hand as I looked outside the window above the sink.

Above, below, all around me people are exiting their rockrete hab-blocks and heading down the long staircases, to the mag-train station in Level 80, East Quadrant. They were all heading uphive, most of them to work in the Grand Archive in some capacity. I would be joining them soon enough.

As I continued sipping my drink, the 08:90 train made its way to the station. That was my queue. I started getting dressed.

"Faustus! You ready mate?" - I heard Jorrick shout outside, his words punctuated by his fists slamming the door.

Of course I was ready, I wouldn't... *couldn't*, get to work late. Not now, not serving the Ordos.

"Mhm..." - I answered calmly, as the door to my hab slid open.

"About time!", he smiled. "That caffeine I smell?". I handed him a plastek cup. "Aha! Cheers.", he said, taking a big gulp. "Ah, that's more like it!"

We started down the stairs, making our way to Level 80. The usual morning chill was greatly nullified by the hundreds of bodies clinking and clanking their way down the zig-zagging metal staircases of the hab-block complex. Hundreds of these hard-cold stairs covered the facade of The Grater, as the building was affectionately known. Still, there was never enough room in rush hour.

Pushing and pulling, twisting and turning, we descended. I could feel the sweat of other people on my skin by the time we reached the station and got on the mag-tram. I'm sure I must have soiled someone's clothes with my caffeine on accident.

"So? How's the new office?" asked Jorrick jokingly, as we reached the platform and stopped to catch our breath.

I smiled. A ThinkPod was an office as much as the underhive was a beauty complex.

"You know I can't talk about it" 

"I know, I know. Just you've been... not yourself, lately. Not that I'm complaining about the raise" he said, raising the caffeine cup.
