The Promotion
=============

Notes
-----

Promise: [Faustus](../people/operator_faustus.md) is small and insignificant. If he shows potential, the system will extract as much as it can out of him, even pushing him to an extreme, and discard him when he burns out. No matter how strong his devotion to the Emperor.

What is the inciting incident? The waking up? The Train ride?

Prose

_thump_, _thump_, _thump_. "Stop."

_Thump_, _Thump_, _Thump_. "No! Please, stop!"

_THUMP_, _THUMP_, _THUMP_. "No!"

The smell of damp laundry opened my nostrils as the hab block shook with the mag-tram passing outside.
Heart pumping, I reached blindly across the room for the aquila ring.

"The Emperor protects. The Emperor protects.", I uttered breathlessly as I clutched the symbol to my bare chest.
    
I opened my eyes, trying to bring my breath back to a reasonable pace. The cracks of the window projected on the ceiling as the carriages of the train carried its human cargo uphive. I lied on my bed a little longer, letting the dancing lights take my mind away from the nightmare.

This had been the worst one yet.

Eventually, my chest started to slow down. I started noticing my surroundings; the stains of sweat on the sheets, the boots of the upstairs neighbours getting ready for the day, and the metallic smell of blood.

"That's new."

I looked down at my hands. I'd been holding on to the symbol too hard. It had left a deep cut in the soft skin of my palm. With a grimace of pain, I let go of the little bronze piece.

They were definitely getting worse. I hand't been able to get a good night's sleep for ages. Not since my ThinkPod reassignment. I didn't know how many more nights like those I could take.

Of course, that was a stupid thought. The ORDOS clearance was a sign that the Inquisition itself had noticed my diligence and skill. The promotion was good, and the Emperor would give me strength to bear any load it carried. Would He not?

As the last echoes of the burning city dissipated from my mind, I got up to get ready for work.

---

The deeply warm smell of freshly brewed caffeine quickly filled the room, making the episode a few moments earlier seem like... well... a bad dream. I brought the warm cup to my lips with a bandadged hand as I looked outside the window above the sink.

Above, below, all around me people were exiting their rockrete hab-blocks and heading down the long staircases, to the mag-train station in Level 80, East Quadrant. They were heading uphive, most of them to work in the Grand Archive in some capacity. I would be joining them soon enough.

As I continued sipping my drink, the 08:90 train made its way to the station. That was my cue. I started getting dressed.

---

"Faustus! You ready mate?" - I heard Jorrick shout outside, his words punctuated by his fists slamming the door.

Of course I was ready. I wouldn't... *couldn't*, get to work late. Not now, not serving the Ordos.

"Mhm..." - I answered calmly, as the door to my hab slid open.

"About time!", he smiled. "That caffeine I smell?". I handed him a plastek cup. "Aha! Cheers.", he said, taking a big gulp. "Ah, that's more like it!"

We started down the stairs, making our way to Level 80. The usual morning chill was greatly nullified by the hundreds of bodies clinking and clanking their way down the zig-zagging metal staircases of the hab-block complex. Thousands of these hard-cold steps covered the facade of The Grater, as the building was affectionately known. Still, there was never enough room in rush hour.

Pushing and pulling, twisting and turning, we descended. I could feel the sweat of other people on my skin by the time we reached the station and got on the mag-tram. I'm sure I must have soiled someone's clothes with my caffeine on accident.

"So? How's the new office?" asked Jorrick jokingly, as we reached the platform and stopped to catch our breath.

I smiled. A ThinkPod was an office as much as the underhive was a beauty complex.

"You know I can't talk about it" 

"I know, I know. Just you've been... odd, lately. Not that I'm complaining about the raise" he said, raising the caffeine cup. "I reckon you've not got some proper shut-eye in a while."

"Mhm...". I finished my cup, as we hurried inside the packed carriage. Jorrick shrugged.

"PLEASE ENSURE THAT ALL EXTREMITIES ARE INSIDE THE CARRIAGE AT ALL *clang*". The mechanized voice of the speakers got interrupted by a loud snap of the closing doors. With a tug, the mag-train started accelerating towards the spires. I stared at the grid of rockrete hab-blocks, their facades blackened by the ever-present mist of the lower hive.

As the train made its way up the rings of //TODO: Hive name, we saw a couple of urban fliers zoom past in the opposite direction. They were painted in arbites bronze, contrasting with the backdrop of smoky bars and neon entertainment houses of the mid-hive.

"Bet they're going to the Graters, those ninkers."

I sighed. They probably were, on their way to collect some poor soul. "They are fulfilling their duty, just like you and me."

"Ha! Cleaning up the mess of the Mechanicum? Some job that is."

"Shush! Don't speak like that!"

There were people staring at this point.

"It just ain't right! How long do you think till one of those ThinkPods drives _you_ nuts?"

"Jorrick!" I was the one shouting now.

"I know, I know." His tone softened, suddenly realizing the averting gazes of his fellow citizens. "Just worry abot my caffeine supply, is all".

He raised his cup and smiled, and I couldn't help but do the same. We turned our gazes back to the distance.

---

The train was shaking in its suspensions as it rushed through the Medicae district. A field of short white marble strips, no more than three stories tall, pointing to a spire of contrasting obsidian. The tower reached into the clouds, as if it were the arm of the hive, pushing itself upright.

"You know? I've always found the Fingers surprisingly similar to ThinkPods" I said, turning to Jorrick.

"Huh, I can see it. Bugger! Now not even //TODO Pod disease will let you get away from the damn things."

"You do know that most people heal from //TODO Pod disease".

"The voices stop alright, but that ain't 'healing' in my book. I reckon they built them so low so that us poor ninkers won't die when we jump off. They don't care about your broken back, if your mind's still sharp."

He did have a point. Just like //TODO Pod disease affected everyone differently, it was hard to predict what the cleanses would do to workers that ended up in the Fingers.

//TODO Character doubt.

---

//NOTE: Jorrick has magically dissappeared here.

Finally, the mag-tram arrived at its final destination. The crowd started pouring out of the carriage, filling the narrow streets that led to the worker's entrance of the Grand Archive. After a brief stop to find a bin to dispose of my cup, I took out my ID pass and made my way to the lines forming at the entrance gates.

While I shambled forwards with the rest of the workers, I looked up, shielding my eyes from the sunlight.

The Great Archive was high enough in //TODO Hive name to be free of the smog. Its gothic towers reached into the clear sky, the suns reflecteing off its stained glass windows. 

The warm morning light highlighted the depictions of the Emperor, for everyone to see. My favourite, "The Sacrifice of //TODO The human guard vs Horus", sparkled with the morning rays.

I touched my signet, closed my eyes, and said a prayer.

"Emperor give me strength to fullfill the duty that I must".

The story of //TODO the human guard, how he saved our beloved Emperor by standing in the way of the traitor Horus, reminds us all that we are all important to the glory of the Imperium. That through piety and infinite determination, we are all valuable for the survival of Humanity.

"Give me courage to face the horrors, and strength to -"

"Move it!" Somebody shoved me forward in the queue. I stumbled, and realized I was already at the gates.

"Sorry, sorry..." I fumbled through my coat, looking for my ID.

Front pockets? No. "Oi! Your Holy Grace! I said move it! I can't be late again!"

Breast pockets? No. "Sir, you you're blocking the queue". A gate guard had come.

"Yes, just a moment. I can't find my pass" 

"It's in your hand, sir". The guard could barely hide a sigh.

"Oh." I blushed, looked down, scanned the pass without a word. As soon as the display beeped green, I rushed through the gates.

Less than ten paced from the gates, my hand started to feel strange. Almost as if it was missing something...

"My ring!" I spun towards the gate. My feet tried to run, but the rest of my body couldn't fight the human tide pouring into the building.

"Let me through, please! I need to get my ring back". Some people in front of me tried to make way for me. They were quickly pushed back by the vacant-eyed mass of people that marched relentlessly to their stations.

I waved my arms, signalling to the guard that had hurried me before. He was picking something off the ground. When he saw me, he turned his head towards me.

"I'm sorry sir, you're going to have to come and pick this up later." The guard put the ring in his pocket.

"But..." 

"Move along!" He commanded, and turned back to attend the incoming crowd.

My heart was racing, and I felt week in my knees. I would have fallen down, if there had been a free inch of floor to do so. The thump of blood was ringing in my ears, reminding me of last night. The burning city, billions being massacred. The sharp lights of orbital lances sweeping across the districts, with chain explosions following a second later. The fire, the screams, the stench of burning flesh. "Oh no, oh Emperor please -"

"You 'eard 'im, move it!" Two strong hands turned me towards the ascending staircase, and shoved me forward.

The smell of smoke lingered, but before me no longer stood the ashen plain, but the great spiral staircase that connected the different sections of the Grand Archive.

I forced myself to take a step forward. Then another one. Stumbling, I joined the crowd, making my way towards ThinkPod 36B, Sectio Ordos.

I would have to come back for the ring later.

---

As I got higher in the spiral staircase, the crowd started thinning. The higher floors of the Grand Archive were limited to the ORDOS and MILITIA clearance levels, where Inquisitors and their retinue came to do their research, and future Generals and Commissars came to study past battles.

I inhaled deeply, letting the smell of static banish the last remnants of the battle for the second time this day. I stopped, appreciating the privilege of having such breathing room.

Yes, it was hard work to retrieve and process documents for the Inquisition. Yes, some of those images stuck like memories. But I had been chosen, and I had a duty to fulfill. They wouldn't have chosen me otherwise. I needed to brave what may come. And besides... "The Emperor protects".

The words made my hands a little bit warmer. I closed my fists, and carried on, up to my station.

---

ThinkPod 36B, Sectio Ordos was cold that day. Two men in janitor uniforms were cleaning the green carpet surrounding the ten Retriever stations, in preparation for the shift change. From his plinth at the end of the room, Magos Cognitor Arsenus emitted an electrical buzz, and a cloud of steam sprouted from the opening in his red robes, where his mouth would have been.

"Good morning to you as well, Magos" I declared, as I walked around the circle of leatherbound armchairs, to station 8.

My station was empty. "Excuse me, do you know what happened to Herc?" I asked the night shift operator to my right, as she was rising from her station, getting ready to leave.

"Damn ninker never showed up." She said. Her breath was still irregular from the last dive, her pupils dilated. "He better come back with a good excuse and a bottle of amasec to share. Now if you'll excuse me, I can't be here anymore." And she shambled down the room.

I sat on my station, making ready. A chill ran down my spine as the HUD of my helmet light up. I felt my pulse rise again, and I touched the place where my ring had been moments ago.

I managed to coerce my shaky hands to strap the belts and perform final checks. "Emperor give me strength". It was going to be a long day.

"WELCOME, RETRIEVERS OF THE ORDOS." Even through the ThinkPod helmet interface, Cognitor Arsenus's voice was canny, more machine than human.

"THE GRAND ARCHIVE THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. YOU ARE THE BEST RETRIEVERS IN //TODO Hive name, FOR WHICH YOU WERE CHOSEN. YOU ARE THE ELITE. MAKE US PROUD." These words marked the imminent dive. Usually, hearing them made me feel proud to be serving the Emperor. Today, they made something snap.

A cold hand gripped my heart. I wasn't ready for this, not again. Cannonfire raged in the distance. I closed my eyes until white dots were dancing inside my pupils and gripped the leather of the armrests, trying to make it go away. Trying to prepare for...

"LET US BEGIN" And the world became data.

---

//This scene needs more physical feedback, make Faustus feel the horrors.

"CAPTAIN ARGOLES, CHAPTER AURORA, THE DISASTER OF THRACIAN PRIMARIS. 338.M41, FILE PREFIXES 50123 TO 109034" declared Arsenus.

Ten minds recieved the order and dove into the thousands of files. Reading, watching, sifing, trying to find the fate of the Astartes captain.

I found a set of cockpit recordings. I sat on the seat of the traitor pilots while they raked through the crowds. I saw them cut down thousands of civilians before precipitating to my death when the fliers were hit with lasfire. But no sign of Argoles.

I found picts of burning buildings, sound recordings of agonizing people, and death rolls that numbered the thousands. But no sign of Argoles.

"Found it!" Said one of the other Retrievers. Our minds snapped back into place, and the voice said "File 89342, it's a camera feed from his helmet."

"WELL DONE. THE GRAND ARCHIVE THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. INQUISITOR GIDEON RAVENOR, ORDO XENOS, THE DISASTER OF THRACIAN PRIMARIS. 338.M41, FILE PREFIXES 70997 TO 134299".

And we sunk, back to fire and blood.

---

By the tenth query, I felt my head about to explode. Quick breaths drew the smell of blood, coming fron the wounds the metal edges of the armrest had cut in my tight-gripping fingers.

My legs were shaking from the impact of the last explosion. A bolt-round from a traitor Astartes splitting some Comissar Friedrik in half.

"STATION 8, PLEASE REMAIN FOCUSED"

"A moment, please! I just need to catch -"

//TODO REFERENCE HORMAGAUNTS IN FROZEN WORLD

Suddenly, a horde of hungry beasts were charging towards me. Behind be, lasfire was trying to slow rhem down. I joined the cacophony with my psi-cannons, but it wasnt enoguh to stop them.

The alien beasts didnt even need to stop as their long, single-bladed claws tore through my unit. Some of them tried attacking me, and their metallic limbs ringed when they met my body.

Whatever I was inside of was sturdy, but every attack opnened bigger gaps in its armor. They✨ started surrounding me, burying me in a flurry of steel and blood. 

_clang, clang, clang_ "No!"

I could feel blood russhing go my ears, and I started gaspung for breath. Sharp pain enveloped me as I felt my head shakenagainst my station's head pillow.

_Clang, clang, clang_

It was too much.

---

And here I am. 

// Goes crazy in this session
// Cut to the present. Medicae in the Fingers are interrogatimg him.
// He realizes he's been cleaned before, and his froend has been dead for a while.
// He starts crying, and they close the door behind him. "Prepare employee X47U for cleansing".
