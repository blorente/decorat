The Promotion
=============

_thump, thump_. 

_Thump, Thump_.

_THUMP, THUMP_.

"No!"

The smell of damp laundry filled my nostrils as the hab block shook with the mag-tram outside.
Heart pumping, I reached blindly across the room for the aquila ring.

"The Emperor is with me. The Emperor protects.", I uttered breathlessly as I clutched the symbol to my bare chest.
    
I opened my eyes, trying to bring my breath back to a reasonable pace. The cracks of the window projected on the ceiling, light up by the passing carriages. I lied on my bed a little longer, letting the dancing lights take my mind away from the nightmare.

This had been the worst one yet.

Eventually, my chest started to slow down. I started noticing my surroundings; the stains of sweat on the sheets, the boots of the upstairs neighbours getting ready for the day, and the metallic smell of blood.

"That's new."

I looked down at my hands. I'd been holding on to the symbol too hard. It had left a deep cut in the soft skin of my palm. With a grimace of pain, I let go of the little bronze piece.

They were definitely getting worse. I hand't been able to get a good night's sleep for ages. Not since my Cognitor reassignment. I didn't know how many more nights like those I could take.

I swallowed hard, battling that thought. The ORDOS clearance was a sign that the Inquisition itself had noticed my diligence and skill. The promotion was good. Besides, the Emperor would give me strength to bear any load it carried, would He not?

As the last echoes of the nightmare dissipated from my mind, I got up to get ready for work.

---

The deeply warm smell of freshly brewed caffeine quickly filled the room, making the episode a few moments earlier seem like... well... a bad dream. I brought the warm cup to my lips with a bandadged hand as I looked outside the window above the sink.

Above, below, all around me, people were exiting their rockrete hab-blocks and heading down the long staircases, to the mag-train station in Level 80, East Quadrant. They were heading uphive, most of them to work in the Grand Archive in some capacity. I would be joining them soon enough.

As I continued sipping my drink, the 08:90 train made its way to the station. That was my cue. I started getting dressed.

---

"Faustus! You ready mate?" - I heard Jorrick shout outside, his words punctuated by his fists slamming the door.

Of course I was ready. I wouldn't -- *couldn't*, get to work late. Not now, not serving the Ordos.

"Mhm..." - I answered calmly, as the door to my hab slid open.

"About time!", he smiled. "That caffeine I smell?". I handed him a plastek cup. "Aha! Cheers.", he said, taking a big gulp. "'mperor bless you mate!" he said with a wink.

I smiled -- despite his sarcasm -- feeling the familiar cold of the aquila ring in my hand. I certainly hoped He did.

We started down the stairs, making our way to Level 80. The morning chill was greatly nullified by the usual mass of bodies going to the station. Boots were clinking and clanking their way down the zig-zagging metal staircases of the hab-block complex. Thousands of these hard-cold steps covered the facade of The Grid, as the building was affectionately known. Still, there was never enough room in rush hour.

Pushing and pulling, twisting and turning, we descended. I could feel the sweat of other people on my skin by the time we reached the station and got on the mag-tram. I'm sure I must have spilled my caffeine on someone's clothes by accident.

"So? How's the new office?" asked Jorrick jokingly, as we reached the platform and stopped to catch our breath.

I smiled. A Cognitor was an office as much as the underhive was a beauty complex.

"You know I can't talk about it" 

"I know, I know. It's just you've been... odd, lately. Not that I'm complaining about the raise" he said, raising the caffeine cup. He smiled, but his eyes betrayed his concern. "I reckon you've not got some proper shut-eye in a while."

"Mhm...". I finished my cup, as we hurried inside the packed carriage. Jorrick shrugged.

"PLEASE ENSURE THAT ALL EXTREMITIES ARE INSIDE THE CARRIAGE AT ALL *clang*". The mechanized voice of the speakers got interrupted by a loud snap of the closing doors. With a tug, the mag-train started accelerating towards the spires. I stared at the rows of rockrete hab-blocks, their facades blackened by the ever-present mist of the lower hive.

---

The train was shaking in its suspensions as it rushed through the Medicae district. Five long white marble strips, no more than three stories tall, formed the bulk of the hospital complex. They were arranged in a neat circle, all reaching out from a spire of contrasting red stone, some twenty stories tall, and windowless.

"You know? I've always found the Fingers surprisingly similar to a Cognitor" I said, turning to Jorrick. I wrangled my arm, trying to bring the cup to my lips through the backs and chests of the surrounding workers filling the space.

"Huh. Yeah, I can see it." He paused for a bit, as if digesting the epiphany "Bugger! Now not even the nuts will let you get away from the damn things."

"You do know that most people heal from Pod Disease". I finally got the cup to my lips, barely spilling anything.

"The voices stop alright, but that ain't 'healing' in my book. Like putting a jackhammer to your head! I reckon they built the Fingers so low so that us poor ninkers won't die if we jump off. They don't care about your broken back, if your mind's still sharp."

He did have a point. Just like Pod Disease affected everyone differently, it was hard to predict what the resets would do to the workers that ended up in the Fingers.

I looked around the carriage; oddly, nobody seemed to rise an eyebrow at the mention of such a sensitive topic. Had they not heard Jorrick? He certainly had been loud enough.

A couple of urban fliers zoomed past the train, towards one of the Medicae buildings. They were painted in arbites bronze, shining bright against the red and white backdrop.

That didn't help Jorrick's mood. "Bet they're coming from the Graters, those ninkers."

I sighed. They probably were, on their way to drop some poor soul. "They are fulfilling their duty, just like you and me."

"Ha! Cleaning up the mess of the Mechanicum? Some job that is."

"Shush! Don't speak like that!" At the sound of my voice, people lifted their heads, startled. 

"It just ain't right! How long do you think till one of those Pods drives _you_ nuts? Talk about the Emperor all you want, but I see what they're doing to you."

"Jorrick!" I was the one shouting now. Why were people staring at me? Jorrick was the one shouting heresy! 

"I know, I know." His tone softened, suddenly realizing he had crossed a line. "Just worry abot my caffeine supply, is all".

He raised his cup and smiled, and I sighed and did the same. I looked out the window, and couldn't help but wonder.

How long indeed?

---

Finally, the mag-tram arrived at its final destination. The crowd started pouring out of the carriage, filling the narrow streets that led to the worker's entrance of the Grand Archive. After a brief stop to find a bin to dispose of my cup, I took out my ID pass and made my way to the lines forming at the entrance gates.

I looked around, but Jorrick was not there anymore. I hadn't seen him step off the train either. I shrugged "Probably lost in the crowd."

The line of workers shambled forwards, silently slipping into the Grand Archive like rain being swallowed by the gutter. I looked up, shielding my eyes from the sunlight.

The Great Archive was high enough in Decorat to be free of the smog. Its eight gothic towers reached into the clear sky. The cold morning light turned vibrant green, red and gold when it reflected in the hundreds of stained glass windows. My favourite, "The Sacrifice of Ollanius Pius", stood at the tip of the smallest tower.

I touched my signet, closed my eyes, and let the sound of a prayer inundate me with light.

"Emperor give me strength to fullfill the duty that I must".

The story of Ollanius Pius, how he saved our beloved Emperor by standing in the way of the traitor Horus, reminds us all that we are all important to the glory of the Imperium. That the Emperor will reward our piety and determination.

"Give me courage to face the horrors, and strength to -"

"Move it!" Somebody shoved me forward in the queue. I stumbled, and realized I was already at the gates.

"Sorry, sorry..." I felt the warmth inside of me fade away with the cold stab of the morning chill. I fumbled through my coat, looking for my ID.

Front pockets? No. "Oi! Your Holy Grace! I said move it! I can't be late again!"

Breast pockets? No. "Sir, you you're blocking the queue". A gate guard was waving his arms, frantically signaling me to hurry.

"Yes, just a moment." I was completely cold now "I can't find my pass" 

"It's in your hand, sir". The guard could barely hide a sigh.

"Oh." I blushed, looked down, and scanned the pass without a word. As soon as the display beeped green, I rushed through the gates.

I had taken less than ten paces from the gates when my hand started feeling strange. Almost as if it was missing something...

"My ring!" I spun towards the gate. My feet tried to run, but the rest of my body couldn't fight the human tide pouring into the building.

"Let me through, please! I need to get my ring back". Some people in front of me tried to make way. They were quickly pushed back by the vacant-eyed mass of people that poured relentlessly into the building.

I waved my arms, signalling to the guard that had hurried me before. He was picking something off the ground. When he saw me, he turned his head towards me.

"I'm sorry sir, you're going to have to come and pick this up later." The guard put the ring in his pocket.

"No, I need that! I need Him..." 

"Move along!" He commanded, and turned back to attend the incoming crowd.

My heart was racing, and I felt week in my knees. I would have fallen down, if there had been a free inch of floor to do so. The thumps of pumping blood were ringing in my ears, just like last night. The burning city. Billions being massacred. The sharp lights of orbital lances sweeping across districts. Chain explosions following a second later. The fire, the screams, the stench of burning flesh. "Oh no, oh Emperor please -"

"You 'eard 'im, move it!" Two strong hands turned me towards the ascending staircase, and shoved me forward.

I snapped out of it. The smell of smoke lingered, but before me no longer stood the ashen plain. Instead, a great staircase spiralled towards the high cealing, connecting the different sections of the Grand Archive.

I forced myself to take a step forward. Then another one. Stumbling, I joined the crowd once again, making my way towards Cognitor 36B, Sectio Ordos.

I would have to come back for the ring later. I just hoped the Emperor would still be with me.

---

As I got higher in the spiral staircase, the crowd started thinning. The higher floors of the Grand Archive were limited to the ORDOS and MILITIA clearance levels, where Inquisitors and their retinue came to do their research, and the Generals and Commissars of the future came to study the past.

I inhaled deeply, letting the smell of static banish the last remnants of the battle for the second time this day. I stopped, appreciating the privilege of having such breathing room.

Yes, it was hard work to retrieve and process documents for the Inquisition. Yes, some of those images stuck like memories. But I had been chosen, and I had a duty to fulfill. They wouldn't have chosen me otherwise. I needed to brave what may come. And besides...

"The Emperor protects".

The words made my hands a little bit warmer. I clenched my fists, and carried on, up to my station.

---

Cognitor 36B, Sectio Ordos was cold that day. Two men in janitor uniforms were cleaning the green carpet surrounding the ten Retriever stations, in preparation for the shift change.


When I got into the room, Adeptus Mechanicum Magos Cognitor Arsenus emmitted a series of electrical buzzes punctuated by a steam cloud that sprouted from an opening in his red robes, where his mouth would have been. The Magos had a perfect view of the room from the plinth he was affixed to, and he had the custom to greet his Retrievers at the start of each shift.

"Good morning to you as well, Magos" I returned the greeting, as I walked around the circle of leatherbound armchairs, to station 8.

My station was empty. "Excuse me, do you know what happened to Herc?" I asked the night shift Retriever to my right, as she was rising from her station, getting ready to leave.

"Damn ninker never showed up." She said. Her breath was still irregular from the last dive, her pupils dilated. "He better come back with a good excuse and a bottle of amasec to share. Now if you'll excuse me, I can't be here anymore." Without one more word, she shambled down the room.

The rest of my shift were already connected. I sat on my station, readying myself. A chill ran down my spine as the HUD of my helmet lit up. I felt my pulse rise again, and I touched the place where my ring had been moments ago. I grimaced in pain as my fingers brushed the bandages of this morning's cut.

I managed to coerce my shaky hands to strap the belts and perform final checks. "The Emperor is with me. The Emperor protects." It was going to be a long day.

My display signalled the successful connection, and ten mind prepared to dive into the depths of the Archive. Reading, watching, sifting, trying to find answers to the queries of the Imperium.

"WELCOME, RETRIEVERS OF THE ORDOS." Even through the ThinkPod helmet interface, Cognitor Arsenus's voice was canny, more machine than human.

"THE GRAND ARCHIVE THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. YOU ARE THE BEST RETRIEVERS IN DECORAT, FOR WHICH YOU WERE CHOSEN. YOU ARE THE ELITE. MAKE US PROUD." These words marked the imminent dive. Usually, hearing them made me feel proud to be serving the Emperor. Today, they made me taste vomit at the back of my throat.

A cold hand gripped my heart. I wasn't ready for this, not again. Cannonfire raged in the distance. I closed my eyes until white dots were dancing inside my pupils and gripped the leather of the armrests, trying to make it go away. Trying to prepare for--

"CAPTAIN ARGOLES, CHAPTER AURORA, THE DISASTER OF THRACIAN PRIMARIS. 338.M41. FILE PREFIXES 50123 TO 109034" declared Arsenus.

"LET US BEGIN" And we plunged into a sea of data.

I found a set of recordings, and I opened it. Within nanoseconds, I was seeing from the cockpit of a fighter jet, flying over a majestic parade. Millions of souls cheered as the Imperium's finest marched by. I started feeling a sense of pride as I watched the impecable legions of the Emperor.

It didn't last long. When we were reaching the crowd, the fighter dived into it, and opened fire. I realized this recording was one of the traitor pilots while they raked through the crowds. I felt sick as I spectated first hand the flier's guns cutting down thousands of civilians, seconds before precipitating to a fiery, sudden death when the Imperium opened fire. No sign of Argoles.

I had to keep searching. My mind jumped from file to file, processing each one before moving to the next one. I found picts of burning buildings, sound recordings of agonizing people, and death rolls that numbered the thousands. But no Argoles.

"Found it!" Said one of the other Retrievers.

Our minds snapped back into place, and I gasped for air.

"File 89342, it's a camera feed from his helmet."

"WELL DONE. THE GRAND ARCHIVE THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE." Without a pause, he added "LET US CONTINUE. INQUISITOR GIDEON RAVENOR, ORDO XENOS, THE DISASTER OF THRACIAN PRIMARIS. 338.M41, FILE PREFIXES 70997 TO 134299".

And we sunk, back to fire and blood.


---


By the tenth query, my head was about to explode. Quick breaths drew the smell of blood, coming from the wound in my hand. I must have opened it again by gripping too hard.

My legs were still shaking from the impact of the last explosion. A bolt-round from a traitor Astartes splitting some Comissar Friedrik in half.

"STATION 8, PLEASE REMAIN FOCUSED"

"A moment, please! I just need to catch --"

"LET US CONTINUTE. INQUISITOR GIDEON RAVENOR, ORDO XENOS, --".

In my confusion, I missed the file coordinates. Desperate, I opened the first recording I found. I was trapped in a box of steel, surrounded by 3 other people. A horde of alien beasts were charging towards the group. The three other people opened fire trying to slow them down. I heard psi-cannons coming from my cage join the cacophony. It wasnt enough to stop them.

The ravenous beasts didnt even need to stop as their long, blade-like claws tore through the people around me. Some of them attacked the box, and their blade-like limbs ringed with the sound of metal on metal: _clang, clang, clang_.

Whatever I was inside of was sturdy, but every attack opnened bigger gaps in its armor. They started surrounding us, burying the viewport in a flurry of steel and blood.

It was too much. I could feel blood rushing to my ears, and I started gasping for breath. Sharp pain enveloped me as I felt my head -- my real head -- hit violently against my station's pillow.

My head exploded, and the world went white.


---


The echoes of metal claws ringing wakes me up. _clang, clang, clang_. As I come to, eyes still closed, I realize it's a different sound. 

_Tap, tap, tap_. 

I feel fresh sheets rub against my bruised neck, sending a sharp pain stab at the back of my head.

Fresh sheets.

This isn't my station.

"Good morning, Faustus" I hear a male voice say. The tapping stops for a second.

I try to open my eyes, but only the left one obeys. The right one responds with a sharp stab of pain instead.

"I wouldn't do that if I were you. That's a nasty bruise you have there."

The well-lit room is empty, except for a single man sitting on a chair, talking to me. He is dressed in starched Medicae uniform, and is scratching the glossy surface of his dataslate as he scribbles something. _Tap, tap, tap_.

"Wh-Where am I?" My lips feel heavy and dry. I can barely form the words.

"You're in Unit 498, East Medicae. You gave us a good scare this morning".

At that mention, I see a flash of sharp, bloody metal claws. My heart skips a beat. I take a deep breath, pushing the memory away.

"What's going to happen to me?" A note of desperation betrays my feigned confidence. I don't think my bruises are the reason I'm in the Fingers, and I suspect he doesn't either.

"Well, Faustus, we're going to make you all better." The man's lips form a practiced smile. His eyes don't. "Don't you worry. Soon, you'll feel... good as new" _Tap, Tap, Tap_.

I swallow hard. So it _is_ a reset. I try to raise my hands, but tight leather bondages bite into my wrists. The man's note-taking intensifies as he sees my struggle.

"Please Faustus, try to calm down".

My head starts spinning, and my heart racing. Those damn taps turn back into resounding _Clangs_.

"You can't do this to me! I'm working for the Ordos! The Emperor needs me!" I'm seeing flashes of red now. Flying, thick, wet streaks of blood red. My whole body's shaking, trying to get out of this damn bed.

The man shrugs, putting the dataslate down. "Have it your way." The smile gone from his lips. The tapping has stopped, but the damage is done. I can barely hear his footsteps approaching through the sounds of battle, but I do feel his hand touching a control beside my head.

Immediately, my body goes numb, and my eyes feel heavy. The blood washes away, like the the rain wiping off the windows of a train.

"Now, go to sleep"

As I submerge in a pool of nothingness, I hear the man's footsteps going away. The door slams shut, leaving me alone in the room.

"Prepare worker FA-X16S for reset" I can barely hear him now, talking to someone outside. 

"Again, sir? Less than a year after the last one? The odds of recovery are --"

"He's critical. We don't want another case like that monster Jorrick." The man pauses. Through the haze of the sedatives, Jorrick's name sounds familiar.

"Oh, would you look at that! According to the file, he and the patient were friends before the man finally snapped and did a number on The Grids. Had to put him down. Now, we don't want another one of those, do we?"

"Of course not, sir."

"Well then get to it. Not like he'll be missed."

As the footseps fade away into the corridor, the room goes dark.

From a corner of the empty room, I hear Jorrick's voice.

"Told'ya mate. Guess you didn't have that long after all."
