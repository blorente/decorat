The Promotion
=============

Notes
-----

Promise: [Faustus](../people/operator_faustus.md) is small and insignificant. If he shows potential, the system will extract as much as it can out of him, even pushing him to an extreme, and discard him when he burns out.

He discovers a mis-clearing of some article, and reports it. 
He is moved to the `Ordos` clearance. He gets a raise, a new house uphive.
The `Ordos` clearance is dangerous, because there are many mind-traps hidden in its documents. Infinite loops that trap minds forever, Un-numbers that break consciousness, corrupting manuscripts.
During his work, he discovers heretic chain. He reports it.
