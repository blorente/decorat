Cognitor
========

A Cognitor is an Adeptus Mechanicus magos specialized in information storage and retrieval.
Cognitors are savants, data addicts, born within the Mechaniucs.

A high-level Cognitor is permanently affixed to a throne, connected by thick data wires to a very powerful data engine.
That throne is also connected to a [ThinkPod](../_artefacts/thinkpod.md), which interfaces between the Cognitor and the hundreds of human minds they use to retrieve data from the [GrandArchive](../_places/grand_archive.md).
