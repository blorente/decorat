The Mind Hive
=============

An archive city. So vast is its knowledge, that most of its population is dedicated to collaborating in information retrieval.
Most people work in the [Cognitarium](cognitarium.md), an information factory.
There, special magos called [Cognitors](../ocupations/cognitor.md) use pods of hundreds of human minds ([ThinkPods](../artefacts/thinkpod.md)) to sift through data, looking for answers to the Imperium's questions.
These human pods are hired from [The Graters](the_graters.md) hab blocks of the lower-mid-hive, where most of the population lives.
