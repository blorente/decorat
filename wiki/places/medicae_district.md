## The Fingers

The Fingers are the five wards for common patients in the Medicae district. They are formed by five long white marble buildings arranged in a circle, 3 stories tall.

They are only 3 stories so that patients don't die when they try to suicide by jumping out of the window, which happens frequently.

## The Arm

A tall red tower at the center of the Fingers.
