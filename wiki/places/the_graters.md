The Graters
===========

The Graters are a series of hab-blocks in the mid-lower hive.
They are gigantic blocks of prefab housing for single people, with zig-zagging metal staircases running through their facades. Viewed from afar, the blackened rockrete of the prefab fades into the hive-smog, and the staircases emit a visible sheen, hence the name.

Each Grater contains thousands of living units, deep narrow cuboids of rockrete stacked on top of each other.

Living Units
------------

Although living units vary in size, the most common one is the single-person unit.
These units have the bare essentials a human needs to live: One bed, a shelf, a basin, and a stove.
There are shared toilets scattered on each floor.
Some of the lucky inhabitants even have a window looking outside their block.

Since the living units are prefabricated, the furniture, lighting, and appliances are affixed in place.
Furthermore, these blocks are so cheap to build and so tightly packed that the Administratum often close down individual blocks and stack more on top of the structure, instead of carrying out repairs.

Transportation
--------------

Every few levels, bridges connect with different tram stations, to move workers in and out of The Graters.
