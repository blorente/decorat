# The Villain

Notes:
- I love the idea of a villain that just wants to see the world burn. It contrasts very nicely with the sense of order Erika has. However, it may be hard to tie that up with her evolution.
- I love the idea of them being someone powerful, that operates covertly.
  - A chief of police?
  - An inquisitor?
  - The headmistress of the scholam?
  - The boss of the biggest MemoryBar in the hive?


Ideas:
- Maybe a colleage from the scholam, who she was always competing with. He had to turn to chaos to gain even a measure of the power that she wielded?
- Maybe it's a local leader of a cult, that in actuality just wants to free people's minds.

What did I like about Molotch?
- He is extremely competent, and plays the long con.
- He is confident, even in tough situations.

What did I not like about Molotch?
- In the end, I don't really remember what he wanted.
