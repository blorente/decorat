## Outline

### Act 1: The Setup
#### Hook
- **Scene:** A drunk on the street.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika has just arrived at Decorat's main pedestrian port. With her personal effects and Tristan by her side, she's making her way towards her mansion. A commotion is forming on the street: A man is being aggressive and insulting the people around him. Doesn't look like there are arbites nearby. As Erika comes closer, the man lurches towards a random bystander, but Erika dispatches him quickly. She talks with the arbites, shows her badge, and is on her way.
    - **The Consequence:** Erika is on her way.
    - **Subplots:** Rien watches the whole thing, and is intrigued by Erika. He's also pissed, because he'd been following that man for a while. He starts following Erika.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Because Erika is faced for the first time with the chaos virus.
    - **The realization:** Fear that _this_ is the state that her father will be in.
  - **Setup for next scene:** Rien Starts following Erika. Erika notices.

- **Scene:** Arrival at the mansion.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika gets to the mansion, which is empty except for the family's butler TODO and the two servitors. She wants to see her father immediately, but the butler recommends that she wait until morning, with a grave face. She asks if anyone has come to visit since her father had fallen ill, and the butler reacts strongly.
    - **The Consequence:** She goes up to her room, talks with Tristan for a bit, and they both go to sleep.
    - **Subplots:** Rien has followed her to the mansion. Erika knows, but she thinks somebody wants to hurt her.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** She is getting even more scared (annoyed?). We get a chance to explore some of her motivations, maybe some of her past.
    - **The realization:** Her father is not just weirdly sick, but something else entirely. This will not do.
  - **Setup for next scene:** We can cut to Rien.

- **Scene:** Rien walks home
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Rien has followed the general to her mansion, and is fuming about her screwing up the man he'd been following for days.
    - **The Consequence:** Rien gets home, and we pan to his sister, exhibiting the same beginning traits of the same thing. He unties her (he had tied her up because he was scared she would escape), and there is dialogue.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** We get to see Rien's connection with his sister. For readers of the short story, they wonder what happened to her. We establish Rien's motivation for tailing the guy.
    - **The realization:** Maybe Erika can help him.
  - **Setup for next scene:** Rien is determined to go over and talk to Erika soon.

#### Inciting Incident
- **Scene:** Nightmares come alive.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika wakes up for TODO reason, and walks around the house. We hear some backstory while she introspects and watches the paintings. When passing through her father's studio, she hears someone shouting. 
    - **The Consequence:** She rushes to her father's study.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** We cement her as a smart, capable and fearless character. But also as a proud one, which is why her father's illness has hurt her so much.
    - **The realization:** She becomes resolute to not let the honor of her house fall. House Belcroft has served the Emperor for generations, and it won't stop now.
  - **Setup for next scene:** Sudden noise, and she rushes.

- **Scene:** Staring in the face of madness.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** She goes into the study, where her father is thrashing at things, very aggresive. Like the man on the street. She tries to reason with him, but he ends up lurching towards her, and she is forced to knock him out. She calls the butler, set her father to bed. 
    - **The Consequence:** She determines to go to the magistratum the following morning, to ask about the man on the harbor.
    - **Subplots:**
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** This is what will set in motion the adventure.
    - **The realization:** Erika realizes her father has the same thing as the man on the docks. She needs to investigate this, and make it better, in order to fix it for her father. 
  - **Setup for next scene:**

- **Scene:** At the magistratum
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika goes to the Magistratum. Using her influence, gets an audience with the people assigned to the case of the man yesterday. They tell her he's been charged with Heresy, and put in the arm.
    - **The Consequence:** Erika realized what I say in the realization. She decides (mini-panics) that she has to get to the truth before they can get to her father. She finds out the address of the person and goes away.
    - **Subplots:** Rien has been following her, and 
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Sets Erika in motion for the rest of the novel. Going to the lowerhive is pretty uncomfortable for her.
    - **The realization:** Erika realizes that she's going to find things before the magistratum (to avoid revelaing her father's illness), and that she'll have to go to the Grids and the mid-lower hive to investigate.
  - **Setup for next scene:** She storms off, heading to her car, ready to take it to the lower hive.

#### The Build-up

- **Scene:** At the man's house. Is this Faustus?
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika arrives at the house, and finds the door open and two people fighting inside. Rien and a thug. Erika dispatches the thug, and almost goes to Rien as well. Rien and Erika have a conversation, which is cut short by the Arbites sirens approaching.
    - **The Consequence:** Rien alerts Erika, and they hide while the arbites register the house. When the danger is gone, Erika tries to dispatch Rien. Rien tries to argue with her that she has a better shot at finding the culprit with him, and shows her a token of Costanza's to prove it (that he got from the house of the man). She takes the token, but refuses to partner up, not trusting the boy, and insists they go their separate ways.
    - **Subplots:**
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Erika crosses a line, inadvertently helping Rien.
    - **The realization:** Erika realizes that she is outside of the normal regulations now.
  - **Setup for next scene:** She is headed to Costanza's 

#### 1st Plot Point

- **Scene:** She mucks up
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika tries to force people in a bar to give her information, trying to intimidate them and pull rank. The barman seems to follow suit, but is actually giving her false information, directing her to a trap.
    - **The Consequence:** She doesn't realize it, but she's headed to a trap.
    - **Subplots:** Rien goes to the bar a few moments after she leaves, and has asked Costanza where the iron lady went. He figures it's a trap, and she might need help.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** This is the setup for Erika's realization that she's out of her depth, and doesn't know how to navigate the streets of the lower hive. The goal is to show to the audience that it's a trap, but not let her see it.
    - **The realization:** This scene is almost purely setup.
  - **Setup for next scene:** I can give a hint that she's heading to a trap.


- **Scene:** It's a trap
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika heads to the address given by the barman. I can invent the setting on the spot (what is interesting for a firefight?), but it's a set-up. Someone is watching her. Suddenly, that someone screams _be careful!_, just in time for her to avoid the shot of a gun. A fight ensues, which Erika and Co. win. The voice is Rien's, which wasn't very useful in the fight.
    - **The Consequence:** Erika has a dialogue with Rien, and she reluctantly agrees to partner with him.
    - **Subplots:** 
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Erika is confronted with the fact that she messed up, and her usual methods don't work.
    - **The realization:**  By agreeing to partner up with Rien, Erika is giving two big steps: She is acknowledging that her methods (and, more importantly, her rank) will very likely not work, and she needs to try new things, and she is placing (some of) her trust in an underhiver. 
  - **Setup for next scene:**
