## Open Questions
- How do we feel about the lack of side characters/locations? Is the bad guy too obvious? I'm 30-odd scenes in, I still have some space to play with a fun character and location.
  - Maybe somewhere in the grand archive?
  - Maybe she uses her connection with Arseuns to consult about some particular ramblings that person had.
  

## Outline

### Act 1: The Setup
#### Hook
- **Scene:** A drunk on the street.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika has just arrived at Decorat's main pedestrian port. With her personal effects and Tristan by her side, she's making her way towards her mansion. A commotion is forming on the street: A man is being aggressive and insulting the people around him. Doesn't look like there are arbites nearby. As Erika comes closer, the man lurches towards a random bystander, but Erika dispatches him quickly. She talks with the arbites, shows her badge, and is on her way.
    - **The Consequence:** Erika is on her way.
    - **Subplots:** Rien watches the whole thing, and is intrigued by Erika. He's also pissed, because he'd been following that man for a while. He starts following Erika.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Because Erika is faced for the first time with the chaos virus.
    - **The realization:** Fear that _this_ is the state that her father will be in.
  - **Setup for next scene:** Rien Starts following Erika. Erika notices.

- **Scene:** Arrival at the mansion.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika gets to the mansion, which is empty except for the family's butler TODO and the two servitors. She wants to see her father immediately, but the butler recommends that she wait until morning, with a grave face. She asks if anyone has come to visit since her father had fallen ill, and the butler reacts strongly.
    - **The Consequence:** She goes up to her room, talks with Tristan for a bit, and they both go to sleep.
    - **Subplots:** Rien has followed her to the mansion. Erika knows, but she thinks somebody wants to hurt her.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** She is getting even more scared (annoyed?). We get a chance to explore some of her motivations, maybe some of her past.
    - **The realization:** Her father is not just weirdly sick, but something else entirely. This will not do.
  - **Setup for next scene:** We can cut to Rien.

- **Scene:** Rien walks home
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Rien has followed the general to her mansion, and is fuming about her screwing up the man he'd been following for days.
    - **The Consequence:** Rien gets home, and we pan to his sister, exhibiting the same beginning traits of the same thing. He unties her (he had tied her up because he was scared she would escape), and there is dialogue.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** We get to see Rien's connection with his sister. For readers of the short story, they wonder what happened to her. We establish Rien's motivation for tailing the guy.
    - **The realization:** Maybe Erika can help him.
  - **Setup for next scene:** Rien is determined to go over and talk to Erika soon.

#### Inciting Incident
- **Scene:** Nightmares come alive.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika wakes up for TODO reason, and walks around the house. We hear some backstory while she introspects and watches the paintings. When passing through her father's studio, she hears someone shouting. 
    - **The Consequence:** She rushes to her father's study.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** We cement her as a smart, capable and fearless character. But also as a proud one, which is why her father's illness has hurt her so much.
    - **The realization:** She becomes resolute to not let the honor of her house fall. House Belcroft has served the Emperor for generations, and it won't stop now.
  - **Setup for next scene:** Sudden noise, and she rushes.

- **Scene:** Staring in the face of madness.
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** She goes into the study, where her father is thrashing at things, very aggresive. Like the man on the street. She tries to reason with him, but he ends up lurching towards her, and she is forced to knock him out. She calls the butler, set her father to bed. 
    - **The Consequence:** She determines to go to the magistratum the following morning, to ask about the man on the harbor.
    - **Subplots:**
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** This is what will set in motion the adventure.
    - **The realization:** Erika realizes her father has the same thing as the man on the docks. She needs to investigate this, and make it better, in order to fix it for her father. 
  - **Setup for next scene:**

- **Scene:** At the magistratum
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika goes to the Magistratum. Using her influence, gets an audience with the people assigned to the case of the man yesterday. They tell her he's been charged with Heresy, and put in the arm.
    - **The Consequence:** Erika realized what I say in the realization. She decides (mini-panics) that she has to get to the truth before they can get to her father. She finds out the address of the person and goes away.
    - **Subplots:** Rien has been following her, and 
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Sets Erika in motion for the rest of the novel. Going to the lowerhive is pretty uncomfortable for her.
    - **The realization:** Erika realizes that she's going to find things before the magistratum (to avoid revelaing her father's illness), and that she'll have to go to the Grids and the mid-lower hive to investigate.
  - **Setup for next scene:** She storms off, heading to her car, ready to take it to the lower hive.

#### The Build-up

- **Scene:** At the man's house. Is this Faustus?
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika arrives at the house, and finds the door open and two people fighting inside. Rien and a thug. Erika dispatches the thug, and almost goes to Rien as well. Rien and Erika have a conversation, which is cut short by the Arbites sirens approaching.
    - **The Consequence:** Rien alerts Erika, and they hide while the arbites register the house. When the danger is gone, Erika tries to dispatch Rien. Rien tries to argue with her that she has a better shot at finding the culprit with him, and shows her a token of Costanza's to prove it (that he got from the house of the man). She takes the token, but refuses to partner up, not trusting the boy, and insists they go their separate ways.
    - **Subplots:**
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Erika crosses a line, inadvertently helping Rien.
    - **The realization:** Erika realizes that she is outside of the normal regulations now.
  - **Setup for next scene:** She is headed to Costanza's 

#### 1st Plot Point

- **Scene:** She mucks up
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika tries to force people in a bar to give her information, trying to intimidate them and pull rank. The barman seems to follow suit, but is actually giving her false information, directing her to a trap.
    - **The Consequence:** She doesn't realize it, but she's headed to a trap.
    - **Subplots:** Rien goes to the bar a few moments after she leaves, and has asked Costanza where the iron lady went. He figures it's a trap, and she might need help.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** This is the setup for Erika's realization that she's out of her depth, and doesn't know how to navigate the streets of the lower hive. The goal is to show to the audience that it's a trap, but not let her see it.
    - **The realization:** This scene is almost purely setup.
  - **Setup for next scene:** I can give a hint that she's heading to a trap.


- **Scene:** It's a trap
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika heads to the address given by the barman. I can invent the setting on the spot (what is interesting for a firefight?), but it's a set-up. Someone is watching her. Suddenly, that someone screams _be careful!_, just in time for her to avoid the shot of a gun. A fight ensues, which Erika and Co. win. The voice is Rien's, which wasn't very useful in the fight.
    - **The Consequence:** Erika has a dialogue with Rien, and she reluctantly agrees to partner with him.
    - **Subplots:** 
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Erika is confronted with the fact that she messed up, and her usual methods don't work.
    - **The realization:**  By agreeing to partner up with Rien, Erika is giving two big steps: She is acknowledging that her methods (and, more importantly, her rank) will very likely not work, and she needs to try new things, and she is placing (some of) her trust in an underhiver. 
  - **Setup for next scene:** 

#### 1st Pinch Point

- **Scene:**
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** We cut to the barman, who recieves a visit from the sub-badguy.
    - **The Consequence:**
    - **Subplots:**
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:**
    - **The realization:**
  - **Setup for next scene:**

### Act 2.1: Reacting

What is her plan? She must have connections in the scholam, and she needs to go there because it's so cool. But not yet, because it's not powerful enough.


- **Scene:** Back at house belcroft, with Rien
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** She and Rien go back to her house, and she goes to heal her wounds, and try to contact her friends at the Scholam. She leaves Rien locked up in the parlor. Rien escapes (he's a Ram after all) because he's bored, and has a chat with the butler. He gains the affections of the butler, maybe with a sob story about his sister, and then tells him about the setup at Costanza's. The butler tells Rien that Mr. Belcroft used to visit that place as well, regrettably, ever since the mother died. They both rush up to talk with Erika, who is trying to get an appointment with the headmaster of the scholam. Erika is a irate at Rien for escaping, but also a little impressed that he managed to pick the lock. The butler manages to calm her down.
    - **The Consequence:** 
    - **Subplots:** Rien gets a taste of the uphive, and sees how different their live is from his.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Because Erika gets a chance to see Rien's competence, and is angry but impressed. 
    - **The realization:** Rien is capable of some good things, and more trustworthy than it seems.
  - **Setup for next scene:** They decide to slip into Constanza's (or the bosse's) at night, but visit the Scholam in the morning.

- **Scene** Rien wanders the Scholam
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Rien is sneaking about the Scholam. He notices the preparations for the Rites of Entry -- The scholam will organize a parade of their best --. Maybe he catches a glimpse of a Cognitor, maybe two people start fighting and they get taken away, who knows where. Maybe we can leave a clue here for later, somebody gets hit in the leg and one of the soldiers has a limp, or something. An Interrogator catches him looking at the cognitors. Rien has only seen PleaseCogs at Memory Bars, so he's taken aback by how intense the trainings are. The interrogator notices his poor clothes or his way of speaking, and after introductions decides that Rien is not dangerous. A conversation ensues. The interrogator explains about Militia and Ordos level cognitors, and Rien realizes that this is related to Chaos, those are the names of daemons, and the interrogator is so cool.
    - **The Consequence:** Rien learns that this is a chaos attack, the audience gets many many clues. We also start setting up the Rites.
    - **Subplots:** Rien starts admiring the Ordos.
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Rien gets to experience the scholam, and his respect for Erika grows. He also gets to meet an inquisitor, who is so cool.
    - **The realization:**
  - **Setup for next scene:** Camera cuts to inside the headmaster's office.
  
- **Scene:** Old mentors
  - **External**
    - **What Happens:** Erika she decides that she'll visit her old headmaster, because she has to wait until night to go into Constanza's through the backdoor. Maybe she says she's there to ask for a job, but in reality she confides with him about her situation. The headmaster says he'll try to help, and mentions some cultists that have been stirring up trouble in the underhive. 
    - **The Consequence:** Erika is thrown a red herring, and is now pursuing a chaos cult in the underhive.
    - **Subplots:**
  - **Internal**
    - **Why it matters:** Erika finds an "ally", and a new set of clues.
    - **The realization:**
  - **Setup for next scene:**

Ideas:
- Maybe after she goes to the grand archive, and inquires about the name of the Daemon the crazy guy was uttering. There is an Interrogator inspecting all the MILITARY and ORDOS queries, as a precaution for all the commotion, and in preparation for the entry rites. They have a brief converstation where the interrogator implies that Erika should be careful, lest this miserious malady will affect her as well. Maybe Erika feels threatened by this.
- Maybe then they go into Constanza's, and they discover something, and the boy does something foolhardy (maybe look for her sister's records), and he gets them caught by the owner of the shop.
- Maybe there is an interrogation scene, where she can outmaneuvre them intellectually to get information, while Rien works on the locks.
- Maybe there is a firefight, and they escape by the skin of their teeth, and then Erika takes Rien to one of the midhive bars, after cleaning up a bit.
- Maybe they go to the bar, and Erika is pissed off at Rien for the stupid thing he did, and Rien explains about his sister, and Erika feels empathy for him. Maybe Rien lightens the mood with some excessive drinking?

### Midpoint Twist

- Maybe Erika and Rien go back to Belcroft house, just to find it trashed. Some bad guys have come, killed the butler and the servitors, and taken (or even killed) her father. Erika is forced to go lay low with Rien, and regroup.
- Crisis scene. This is no longer about honor, or secrecy. This is personal.
- Pinch Point: The audience gets the reveal that the headmaster is the bad guy, and he wanted to kill Erika, and he didn't find her. 

### Act 2.2: Proacting

- She must infiltrate the Arm, whith the help of Rien, to recover the crazy man.
- There must be a couple of scenes where Erika feels really bad about infiltrating the arm, and she does it regardless. Maybe this is a good opportunity to revisit some of the other crewmembers.
- They recover the man, and amongst her ravings Rien (of maybe his sister?) remembers that this is very similar to that guy Jorrick. They got the assignment at Constanza's...
- She goes back to the kingpin of Constanza's, and collaborates with him. He lends his psykers, who recover from the bartender the memory of the guy that made the order in the first place.


### Act 3: The Resolution
#### Supposed Victory
- She goes to confront the headmaster, and the goose is up. The headmaster escapes "you have no idea what's coming..."

#### Disaster
- How do they realize that the actual plan is to infect the things in the rites of entry?

#### Dark Moment
- Her father is dead. Was it all in vain?

#### Recovery
- Reinforcements? I stand for order and the Imperium. **True nobility is to fight for what's right.**

#### Climactic Confrontation
- Preparation Montage.
- Crashing the rites.

#### Victory
- Yay!

#### The Resolution
- Erika is new headmistress of the scholam, and Rien is in training.
