PleaseCog
=========

These are underground Cognitor pods, designed for pleasure.
One can go to an underhive PleaseCog bar and explore someone else's memories.

Donations
---------

There are two ways the underhive gangs can get memories:
- Someone voluntarily surrenders their own memories.
- Retrievers in need of cash sometimes smuggle things and donate them to the PleaseCogs, in exchange for money. Needless to say, this is very risky and absolutely forbidden.

In either case, the memories are extracted by rogue psykers employed by underhive gangs.

Addicts
-------

There are people that can't stomach the reality of their lives, and turn to PleaseCogs. It's not unheard of for Retrieves, particularly those with menial jobs, to want to live their lives in PleaseCogs, and go from work at the archive to their bar of choice, interacting with their world the minimum amount.
