Think Pods
==========

A [ThinkPod](thinkpod.md) is an interface, connecting the minds of hundreds of humans to the throne of a [Cognitor](../ocupations/cognitor.md).


A human connected to a Thinkpod can read documents and follow references.
If they try to access a file above their restricted level, the system sends a small shock to the pain receptors of the brain. This feels like an incredibly thin needle was being pushed into the back of your neck.
